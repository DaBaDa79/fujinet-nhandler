7          0007          TSTDAT

RAM test data register. Reads one
when the B or the right cartridge is
inserted.

RAMLO, TRAMSZ and TSTDAT are all
used in testing the RAM size on
powerup. On DOS boot, RAMLO and
TRAMSZ also act as temporary storage
for the boot continuation address.
TRAMSZ and TSTDAT are used later to
flag whether or not the A (left)
and/or B (right) cartridges,
respectively, are plugged in (non-
zero equals cartridge plugged in)
and whether the disk is to be hooted.

Locations eight through 15 ($8-$F)
are cleared on coldstart only.
