10          000A          DOSVEC

Start vector for disk (or
non-cartridge) software. This is the
address BASIC jumps to when you call
up DOS. Can be set by user to point
to your own routine, but RESET will
return DOSVEC to the original
address. To prevent this, POKE 5446
with the LSB and 5450 with the MSB
of your vector address and re-save
DOS using the WRITE DOS FILES option
in the menu. Locations 10 and 11 are
usually loaded with 159 and 23 ($9F
and $17), respectively. This allows
the DUPSYS section of DOS to be
loaded when called. It is initially
set to blackboard mode vector
(58481; $E471--called by typing
"BYE" or "B." from BASIC); it will
also vector to the cassette run
address if no DOS vector is loaded
in. If you create an AUTORUN.SYS
file that doesn't end with an RTS
instruction, you should set BOOT? to
one and 580 ($244) to zero.
