Pointer to the data buffer, the
contents of which are transmitted
during an I/O operation, used by SIO
and the Device Control Block (DCB);
points to the byte to send or
receive. Bytes are transferred to
the eight-bit parallel serial output
holding register or from the input
holding register at 53773 ($D20D).
This register is a one-byte location
used to hold the eight bits which
will be transmitted one bit at a
time (serially) to or from the
device. The computer takes the eight
bits for processing when the
register is full or replaces another
byte in it when empty after a
transmission.
