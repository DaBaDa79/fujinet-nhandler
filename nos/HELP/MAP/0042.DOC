66          0042          CRITIC

Critical I/O region flag; defines
the current operation as a time-
critical section when the value here
is non-zero. Checked at the NMI
process after the stage one VBLANK
has been processed.  POKEing any
number other than zero here will
disable the repeat action of the
keys and change the sound of the
CTRL-2 buzzer.

Zero is normal; setting CRITIC to a
non-zero value suspends a number of
OS processes including system
software timer coun- ting (timers
two, three, four and five; see
locations 536 to 558; $218 to $22E).
It is suggested that you do not set
CRITIC for any length of time. When
one timer is being set, CRITIC stops
the other timers to do so, causing a
tiny amount of time to be "lost."
When CRITIC is zero, both stage one
and stage two VBLANK procedures will
be executed. When non-zero, only the
stage one VBLANK will be processed.
