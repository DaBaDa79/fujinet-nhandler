85          0055          COLCRS

Current graphics or text mode cursor
column; values range from zero to
319 (high byte, for screen mode
eight) depending on current GRAPHICS
mode (maximum numher of columns
minus one). Location 86 will always
be zero in modes zero through seven.
Home position is 0,0 (upper
left-hand corner). Columns run
vertically from the top to the
bottom down the TV screen, the
leftmost column being number zero,
the rightmost column the maximum
value in that mode. The cursor has a
complete top to bottom, left to
right wraparound on the screen.

ROWCRS and COLCRS define the cursor
location for the next element to be
read from or written to in the main
screen segment of the display. For
the text window cursor, values in
locations 656 to 667 ($290 to $29B)
are exchanged with the current
values in locations 84 to 95 ($54 to
$5F), and location 123 ($7B) is set
to 255 ($FF) to indicate the swap
has taken place. ROWCRS and COLCRS
are also used in the DRAW and FILL
functions to contain the values of
the endpoint of the line being
drawn. The color of the line is kept
in location 763 ($2FB). These values
are loaded into locations 96 to 98
($60 to $62) so that ROWCRS and
COLCRS may be altered during the
operation.

BASIC's LOCATE statement not only
examines the screen, but also moves
the cursor one position to the right
at the next PRINT or PUT statement.
It does this by updating locations
84 and 85, above. You can override
the cursor advance by saving the
contents of the screen before the
LOCATE command, then restoring them
after the LOCATE. Try:

100  REM: THE SCREEN MUST HAVE BEEN 0PENED FOR READ OR READ/WRITE PREVIOUSLY
110  LOOK = PEEK(84): SEE = PEEK(85)
120  LOCATE X,Y,THIS
130  POKE 84, LOOK: POKE 65, SEE

Note that CHR$(253) is a
non-printing character, the bell,
and doesn't affect the cursor
position.

See COMPUTE!, August 1981, for an
example of using COLCRS for dynamic
data restore and updating with the
screen editor and the IOCBs.
