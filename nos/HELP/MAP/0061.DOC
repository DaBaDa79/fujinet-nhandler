Point (column) to which DRAWTO and
XIO 18 (FILL) will go.  NEWROW and
NEWCOL are initialized to the values
in ROWCRS and COLCRS (84 to 86; $54
to $56) above, which represent the
destination end point of the DRAW
and FILL functions. This is done so
that ROWCRS and COLCRS can be
altered during these routines.
