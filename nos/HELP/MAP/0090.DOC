741          02E5          MEMTOP

Pointer to the top of free memory
used by both BASIC (which calls it
HIMEM) and the OS, passed here from
TRAMSZ, location 6 after powerup.
This address is the highest free
location in RAM for programs and
data. The value is updated on
powerup, when RESET is pressed, when
you change GRAPHICS mode, or when a
channel (IOCB) is OPENed to the
display. The display list starts at
the next byte above MEMTOP.

The screen handler will only OPEN
the S: device if no RAM is needed
below this value (i.e. there is
enough free RAM below here to
accommodate the requested GRAPHICS
mode change).  Memory above this
address is used for the display list
and the screen display RAM. Also, if
a screen mode change would extend
the screen mode memory below APPMHI
(locations 14, 15: $E, $F), then the
screen is set back for GR.0, MEMTOP
is updated, and an error is returned
to the user. Otherwise the mode
change will take place and MEMTOP
will be updated.

Space saved by moving MEMTOP is
below the display list. Be careful
not to overwrite it if you change
GRAPHICS modes in mid-program. When
using memory below MEMTOP for
storage, make sure to set APPMHI
above your data to avoid having the
screen data descend into it and
destroy it.
