TOPIC: MAP/UNUSED_00D0

208-209        00D0-00D1     ....

Unused by BASIC. The only time I
have seen any of these unused
locations in use is in COMPUTE!
(March 1982 and October 1981), when
they were used for user sort
routines, and in ANTIC (June 1982),
where they were used as flags in a
graphic demonstration. The bytes
from 203 to 209 ($CB to $D1) are the
only page zero bytes uncontestably
left free by BASIC.
