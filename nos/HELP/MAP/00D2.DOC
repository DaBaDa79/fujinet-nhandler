Reserved for BASIC or other
cartridge use.

Locations 212 to 255 ($D4 to $FF)
are reserved for the floating point
package use. The FP routines are in
ROM, from locations 55296 to 57393
($D800 to $E031). These page zero
locations may be used if the FP
package is not called by the user's
program. However, do not use any of
these locations for an interrupt
routine, since such routines might
occur during an FP routine called by
BASIC, causing the system to crash.

Floating Point uses a six-byte
precision. The first byte of the
Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) number is
the exponent (where if BIT 7 equals
zero, then the number is positive;
if one, then it is negative). The
next five bytes are the mantissa. If
only that were all there was to it.
The BCD format is rather complex and
is best explained in chapter eight
of De Re Atari.
