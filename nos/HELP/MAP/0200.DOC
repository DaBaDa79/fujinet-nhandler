--------------------------------------
PAGES TWO TO FOUR

Locations 512 to 1151 ($200 to $47F)
are used by the OS for working
variables, tables and data buffers.
In this area, locations 512 to 553
($200 to $229) are used for
interrupt vectors, and locations 554
to 623 ($22A to $26F) are for
miscellaneous use. Much of pages two
through five cannot be used except
by the OS unless specifically noted.
A number of bytes are marked as
"spare", i.e., not in use currently.
The status of these bytes may change
with an Atari upgrade, so their use
is not recommended.

There are two types of interrupts:
Non-Maskable Interrupts (NMI)
processed by the ANTIC chip and
Interrupt Requests (IRQ) processed
by the POKEY and the PIA chips.
NMI's are for the VBLANK interrupts
(VBI's; 546 to 549, $222 to $225),
display list interrupts (DLI) and
RESET key interrupts. They initiate
the stage one and stage two VBLANK
procedures; usually vectored through
an OS service routine, they can be
vectored to point to a user routine.
IRQ's are for the timer interrupts,
peripheral and serial bus
interrupts, BREAK and other key
interrupts, and 6502 BRK instruction
interrupts. They can usually be used
to vector to user routines. See
NMIST 54287 ($D40F) and IRQEN 53774
($D20E) for more information. NMI
interrupt vectors are marked NMI;
IRQ interrupt vectors are marked
IRQ.  Refer to the chart below
location 534 for a list of the
interrupt vectors in the new OS "B"
version ROMs.

512          0200          VDSLST

The vector for NMI Display List
Interrupts (DLI): containing the
address of the instructions to be
executed during a DLI (DLI's are
used to interrupt the processor flow
for a few microseconds at the
particular screen display line where
the bit was set, allowing you to do
another short routine such as music,
changing graphics modes, etc.). The
OS doesn't use DLI's; they must be
user- enabled, written and vectored
through here. The NMI status
register at 54287 ($D40F) first
tests to see if an interrupt was
caused by a DLI and, if so, jumps
through VDSLST to the routine
written by the user. DLI's are
disabled on powerup, but VBI's are
enabled (see 546 to 549; $222 to
$225).

VDSLST is initialized to point to
59315 ($E7B3), which is merely an
RTI instruction. To enable DLI's,
you must first POKE 54286 ($D40E)
with 192 ($C0); otherwise, ANTIC
will ignore your request. You then
POKE 512 and 513 with the address
(LSB/MSB) of the first assembly
language routine to execute during
the DLI.  You must then set BIT 7 of
the Display List instruction(s)
where the DLI is to occur. You have
only between 14 and 61 machine
cycles available for your DLI,
depending on your GRAPHICS mode. You
must first push any 6502 registers
onto the stack, and you must end
your DLI with an RTI instruction.
Because you are dealing with machine
language for your DLI, you can POKE
directly into the hardware registers
you plan to change, rather than
using the shadow registers that
BASIC uses.

There is, unfortunately, only one
DLI vector address. If you use more
than one DLI and they are to perform
different activities, then changing
the vectoring to point to a
different routine must be done by
the previous DLI's themselves.

Another way to accomplish interrupts
is during the VBLANK interval with a
VBI. One small problem with using
DLI's is that the keyboard "click"
routine interferes with the DLI by
throwing off the timing, since the
click is provided by several calls
to the WSYNC register at 54282
($D40A). Chris Crawford discusses
several solutions in De Re Atari,
but the easiest of them is not to
allow input from the keyboard! See
Micro, December 1981, Creative
Computing, July 1981 and December
1981.  Here's a short example of a
DLI. It will print the lower half of
your text screen upside down:

10  START = PEEK(560) + PEEK(561) * 256: POKE START + 16,130
20  PAGE = 1536: FOR PGM = PAGE TO PAGE + 7: READ BYTE: POKE PGM, BYTE: NEXT PGM
30  DATA 72,169,4,141,1,212,104,64
40  POKE 512,0: POKE 513,6: POKE 54286,192
50  FOR TEST = 1 TO 240: PRINT"SEE ";: NEXT TEST
60  GOTO 60

Another example of a DLI changes the
color of the bottom half of the
screen. To use it, simply change the
PAGE + 7 to PAGE + 10 in the program
above and replace line 30 with:

30   DATA 72,169,222,141,10,212,141,24,208,104,64

Finally, delete lines 50 and 60. See
also location 54282 ($D40A).
