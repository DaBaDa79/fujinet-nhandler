Serial (peripheral) proceed line
vector, initialized to 59314
($E7B2), which is merely a PLA, RTI
instruction sequence. It is used
when an IRQ interrupt occurs due to
the serial I/O bus proceed line
which is available for peripheral
use. According to De Re Atari, this
interrupt is not used and points to
a PLA, RTI instruction sequence.
This interrupt is handled by the PIA
chip and can be used to provide more
control over external devices.  See
the OS Listing, page 33.
