520          0208          VKEYBD

POKEY keyboard interrupt vector,
used for an interrupt generated when
any keyboard key is pressed other
than BREAK or the console buttons.
Console buttons never generate an
interrupt unless one is specifically
user-written. VKEYBD can be used to
process the key code before it
undergoes conversion to ATASCII
form. Initialized to 65470 ($FFBE)
which is the OS keyboard IRQ routine.
