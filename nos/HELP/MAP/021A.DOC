stage two VBLANK. Can be decremented
every stage one VBLANK, subject to
critical section test as defined by
setting of CRITIC flag (location 66;
$42). This timer may miss (skip) a
count when time-critical code

executed. It performs a JSR through
location 552, 553 ($228, $229) when
the value counts down to zero.
