VBLANK immediate register. Normally
jumps to the stage one VBLANK vector
NMI interrupt processor at location
59345 ($E7D1); in the new OS "B"
ROMs; 59310, $E7AE). The NMI status
register tests to see if the
interrupt was due to a VBI (after
testing for a DLI) and, if so,
vectors through here to the VBI
routine, which may be user-written.
On powerup, VBI's are enabled and
DLI's are disabled. See location
512; $200.
