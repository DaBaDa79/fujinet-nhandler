Priority selection register, shadow
for 53275 ($D01B). Priority options
select which screen objects will be
"in front" of others. It also
enables you to use all four missiles
as a fifth player and allows certain
overlapping players to have
different colors in the areas of
overlap. You add your options up as
in location 559, prior to POKEing
the total into 623. In this case,
choose only one of the four
priorities stated at the beginning.
BAK is the background or border. You
can also use this location to select
one of GTIA GRAPHICS modes nine,
ten, or eleven.

Dec Bit   Priority options in order
  1   0   Player 0-3, playfield 0-3,
          BAK (background)
  2   1   Player 0-1, playfield 0-3,
          player 2-3, BAK

  4   2   Playfield 0-3, player 0-3,
          BAK
  8   3   Playfield 0-1, player 0-3,
          playfield 2-3, BAK


            Other Options
 16   4   4 missiles = 5th player
 32   5   Overlaps of players have
          3rd color

128   7   GRAPHICS 10 (GTIA mode)
192  6,7  GRAPHICS 11 (GTIA mode)

It is quite easy to set conflicting
priorities for players and
playfields. In such a case, areas
where both overlap when a conflict
occurs will turn black. The same
happens if the overlap option is not
chosen.

With the color/overlap enable, you
can get a multicolor player by
combining players. The Atari
performs a logical OR to colors of
players 0/1 and 2/3 when they
overlap. Only the 0/1, 2/3
combinations are allowed; you will
not get a third color when players 1
and 3 overlap, for example (you will
get black instead).  If player one
is pink and player 0 is blue, the
overlap is green. If you don't
enable the overlap option, the area
of overlap for all players will be
black.

In GTIA mode nine, you have 16
different luminances of the same
hue. In BASIC, you would use
SETCOLOR 4,HUE,0. To see an example
of GTIA mode nine, try:

10   GRAPHICS 9: SETCOLOR 4,9,0
20   FOR LOOP = 1 TO 15: COLOR LOOP
30   FOR LINE = 1 TO 2
40   FOR TEST = 1 TO 25: PLOT 4 + TEST, LOOP + LINE +  SPACE: NEXT TEST
45   NEXT LINE
50   SPACE = SPACE + 4
60   NEXT LOOP
70   GOTO 70: REM WITHOUT THIS LINE, SCREEN WILL RETURN TO GR.0

In GTIA mode ten, you have all nine
color registers available; hue and
luminance may be set separately for
each (it would otherwise allow 16
colors, but there are only nine
registers). Try this to see:

10   N = 0: GRAPHICS 10
20   FOR Q = 1 TO 2
30   FOR B = 0 TO 8: POKE 704 + B, N * 16 + A
35   IF A > 15 THEN A = 0
40   COLOR B
45   A = A + 1: N = N + 1
50   IF N > 15 THEN N = 0
60   NEXT B
65   TRAP 70: NEXT Q
70   POP: N = N + 1: FOR Z = 1 TO 200 : NEXT Z
75   GOTO 30

GTIA mode eleven is similar to mode
nine except that it allows 16
different hues, all of the same
luminance. In BASIC, use SETCOLOR
4,O,luminance. Try this for a GTIA
mode eleven demonstration:

10   GRAPHICS 11
20   FOR LOOP = 0 TO 79: COLOR LOOP:PLOT LOOP,0: DRAWTO LOOP,191: NEXT LOOP
30   GOTO 30

You can use these examples with the
routine to rotate colors, described
in the text preceding location 704.
GTIA mode pixels are long and
skinny; they have a four to one
horizontal length to height ratio.
This obviously isn't very good for
drawing curves and circles!

GTIA modes are cleared on the OPEN
command. How can you tell if you
have the GTIA chip? Try POKE 623,64.
If you have the GTIA, the screen
will go all black. If not, you don't
have it. Here is a short routine,
written by Craig Chamberlain and
Sheldon Leemon for COMPUTE!, which
allows an Atari to test itself for
the presence of a CTIA or GTIA chip.
The routine flashes the answer on
the screen, hut can easily be
modified so a program will "know"
which chip is present so it can
adapt itself accordingly:

10 POKE 66,1:GRAPHICS 8:POKE
709,0:POKE 710,0:POKE 66,0:POKE
623,64:P0KE 53248,42:POKE
5326l,3:PUT#6,1
20 POKE 53278,0:FOR K=1 TO 300:NEXT
K:GRAPHICS 18:POKE 53248,0:POSITION
8,5:? #6;CHR$(71-PEEK(53252));"TIA"
30 POKE 708,PEEK(20):GOTO 30

How can you get the GTIA if you
don't have one? Ask your local Atari
service representative or dealer, or
write directly to Atari in
Sunnyvale, California.

See the GTIA/CTIA introduction at
location 53248 ($D000) for more
discussion of the chip. See BYTE,
May 1982, COMPUTE!, July through
September 1982, and De Re Atari for
more on the GTIA chip, and the GTIA
Demonstration Diskette from the
Atari Program Exchange (APX).
