624          0270          PADDL0

The value of paddle 0 (paddles are
also called pots, short for
potentiometer); PEEK 624 returns a
number between zero and 228 ($E4),
increasing as the knob is turned
counter-clockwise.  When used to
move a player or cursor (i.e., PLOT
PADDLE(0),0), test your screen
first. Many sets will not display
locations less than 48 ($30) or
greater than 208 ($D0), and in many
GRAPHICS modes you will get an ERROR
141 -- cursor out of range. Paddles
are paired in the controller jacks,
so paddle 0 and paddle 1 both use
jack one. PADDL registers are
shadows for POKEY locations 53760 to
53767 ($D200 to $D207).
