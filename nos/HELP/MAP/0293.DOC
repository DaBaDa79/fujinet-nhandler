Contains the current split-screen
text window GRAPHICS mode.  It is
the split-screen equivalent to
DINDEX (location 87; $57) and is
always equal to zero when location
128 ($7B) equals zero.  Initialized
to zero (which represents GR.0). You
can alter the display list to change
the text window into any GRAPHICS
mode desired. If you do so, remember
to change TINDEX to reflect that
alteration.
