Pixel location mask. DMASK contains
zeroes tor all bits which do not
correspond to the specific pixel to
be operated upon, and ones for bits
which do correspond, according to
the GRAPHICS mode in use, as follows:

                     Pixels per
          GR. Modes  display byte

A pixel (short for picture cell or
picture element) is a logical unit
of video size which depends on the
GRAPHICS mode in use for its
dimensions. The smallest pixel is in
GR.8 where it is only .5 color clock
wide and one scan line high. In GR.0
it is also only .5 color clock wide,
but it is eight scan lines high.
Here is a chart of the pixel sizes
for each mode:

Modes;      Text       Graphics

The number of pixels per screen
width is based on the normal
playfield screen. See location 559
($22F) for information on playfield
size.
