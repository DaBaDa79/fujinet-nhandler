694          02B6          INVFLG

Inverse character flag; zero is
normal and the initialization value
(i.e., normal ATASCII video codes
have BIT 7 equals zero). You POKE
INVFLG with 128 ($80) to get inverse
characters (BIT 7 equals one). This
register is normally set by toggling
the Atari logo key; however, it can
be user-altered. The display handler
XOR's the ATASCII codes with the
value in INVFLG at all times.  See
location 702 ($2BE) below.

INVFLG works to change the input,
not the output. For example, if you
have A$ = "HELLO", POKE 694, 128
will not change A$ when you PRINT it
to the screen. However, if you POKE
694, 128 before an INPUT A$, the
string will be entered as inverse.
