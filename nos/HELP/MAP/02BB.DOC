Scroll flag; set if a scroll occurs.
It counts the number of physical
lines minus one that were deleted
from the top of the screen. This
moves the entire screen up one
physical line for each line scrolled
off the top. Since a logical line
has three physical lines, SCRFLG
ranges from zero to two.

Scrolling the text window is the
equivalent to scrolling an entire
GR.0 screen. An additional 20-line
equivalent of bytes (800) is
scrolled upwards in the memory below
the text window address.  This can
play havoc with any data such as P/M
graphics you have stored above RAMTOP
