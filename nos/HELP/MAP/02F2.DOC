754          02F2          CH1

Prior keyboard character code (most
recently read and accepted). This is
the previous value passed from 764
($2FC). If the value of the new key
code equals the value in CH1, then
the code is accepted only if a
suitable key debounce delay has
taken place since the prior value
was accepted.
