763          02FB          ATACHR

Returns the last ATASCII character
read or written or the value of a
graphics point. ATACHR is used in
converting the ATASCII code to the
internal character code passed to or
from CIO. It also returns the value
of the graphics point. The FILL and
DRAW commands use this location for
the color of the line drawn, ATACHR
being temporarily loaded with the
value in FILDAT, location 765; $2FD.
To force a color change in the line,
POKE the desired color number here
(color * sixteen + luminance). To
see this register in use as
character storage, try:

10 OPEN#2,4,0,"K:"
20 GET#2,A
30 PRINT PEEK(763);" "; CHR$(A)
40 GOTO 20

Make sure the PEEK statement comes
before the PRINT CHR$ statement, or
you will not get the proper value
returned. When the RETURN key is the
last key pressed, ATACHR will show a
value of 155.
