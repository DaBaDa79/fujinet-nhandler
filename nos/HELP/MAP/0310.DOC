784          0310          TIMER2

Final timer value. Timer one and
timer two contain reference times
for the start and end of the fixed
bit pattern receive period.  The
first byte of each timer contains
the VCOUNT value (54283; $D40B), and
the second byte contains the current
realtime clock value from location
20 ($14). The difference between the
timer values is used in a lookup
table to compute the interval for
the new values for the baud rate
passed on to location 750, 751
($2EE, $2EF).
