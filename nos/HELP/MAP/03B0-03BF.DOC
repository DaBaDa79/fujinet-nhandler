IOCB seven. LPRINT automatically
uses channel seven for its use. If
the channel is OPEN for some other
use and an LPRINT is done, an error
will occur, the channel will be
CLOSEd, and subsequent LPRINTs will
work. The LIST command also uses
channel seven, even if channel seven
is already OPEN. However, when the
LIST is done, it CLOSEs channel
seven. The LOAD command uses channel
seven to transfer programs to and
from the recorder or disk. LIST
(except to the display screen), LOAD
and LPRINT also close all sound
voices. The RUN from tape or disk
and SAVE commands use channel seven,
as does LIST.  The bytes within each
IOCB are used as follows:

Label    Offset Bytes Description
-------------------------------------
ICHID    0      1     Index into the
  device name table for the
currently
  OPEN file. Set by the OS. If not
in
  use, the value is 255 ($FF), which
  is also the initialization value.

Label    Offset Bytes Description
-------------------------------------
ICDNO    1      1     Device number
  such as one for D1: or two for
  D2:. Set by the OS.

Label    Offset Bytes Description
-------------------------------------
ICCOM    2      1     Command for the
  type of action to be taken by the
  device, set by the user. This is
  the first variable after the chan-
  nel number in an OPEN command. See
  below for a command summary. Also
  called ICCMD.

Label    Offset Bytes Description
-------------------------------------
ICSTA    3      1     The most recent
  status returned by the device, set
  by the OS. May or may not be the
  same value as that which is re-
  turned by the STATUS request in
  BASIC. See the OS User's Manual,
  pp. 165-166, fora list of status
  byte values.

Label    Offset Bytes Description
-------------------------------------
ICBAL/H  4,5    2     Two-byte (LSB,
  MSB) buffer address for data trans-
  fer or the address of the file name
  for OPEN, STATUS, etc.

Label    Offset Bytes Description
-------------------------------------
ICPTL/H  6,7    2     Address of the
  device's put- one-byte routine
  minus one. Set by the OS at OPEN
  command, but not actually used by
  the OS (it is used by BASIC, how-
  ever). Points to CIO's "IOCB NOT
  OPEN" message at powerup.

Label    Offset Bytes Description
-------------------------------------
ICBLL/H  8,9    2     Buffer length
  set to the maximum number of bytes
  to transfer in PUT and GET oper-
  ations. Decremented by one for each
  byte transferred; updated after
  each READ or WRITE operation.
  Records the number of bytes act-
  ually transferred in and out of the
  buffer after each operation.

Label    Offset Bytes Description
-------------------------------------
ICAX1    10     1     Auxiliary byte
  number one, referred to as AUX1.
  Used in the OPEN statement to spe-
  cify the type of file access:
   4 for READ,
   8 for WRITE,
  12 for both (UPDATE).
  Not all devices can use both kinds
  of operations.  This byte can be
  used in user-written drivers for
  other purposes and can be altered
  in certain cases once the IOCB has
  been OPENed (see the program exam-
  ple above). For the S: device, if
  AUX1 equals 32, it means inhibit
  the screen clear function when
  changing GRAPHICS modes. Bit use is
  as follows for most applications:

Bit  7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
Use  ....unused...   W   R   D   A

W equals write, R equals read, D
equals directory, A equals append.

ICAX2     11      1     Auxiliary
byte two, referred to as AUX2.
Special use by each device driver;
some serial port functions may use
this byte. Auxiliary bytes two to
five have no fixed use; they are
used to contain device-dependent
and/or user-established data.

ICAX3/4   12,13   2     Auxiliary
bytes three and four; used to
maintain a record of the disk sector
number for the BASIC NOTE and POINT
commands.

ICAX5     14      1     Auxiliary
byte five. Used by NOTE and POINT to
maintain a record of the byte within
a sector.  It stores the relative
displacement in sector from zero to
124 ($7C). Bytes 125 and 126 of a
sector are used for sector-link
values, and byte 127 ($7F) is used
as a count of the number of data
bytes in actual use in that sector.

ICAX6     15      1     Spare
auxiliary byte.

Offset is the number you would add
to the start of the IOCB in order to
POKE a value into the right field,
such as POKE 832 + OFFSET, 12.

The following is a list of the
values associated with OPEN
parameter number 1. Most of these
values are listed in Your Atari
400/800. These are the values found
in ICAX1, not the ICCOM values.

Device  Task# Description
------- ----- ----------------------
Cassette   4  Read
recorder   8  Write (can do either,
              not both)

Disk       4  Read
file       6  Read disk directory
           8  Write new file. Any
              file OPENed in this
              mode will be deleted,
              and the first byte
              written will be at the
              start of the file.
           9  Write--append. In this
              mode the file is left
              intact, and bytes 
              written are put at the
              end of the file.
          12  Read and write--update. 
              Bytes read or written
              will start at the first
              byte in the file.

D: if BIT 0 equals one and BIT 3
equals one in AUX1,then operation
will be appended output.

Screen     8  Screen output
editor    12  Keyboard input and 
              screen output
(E:)      13  Screen input and output

E: BIT 0 equals one is a forced read
(GET command).

Keyboard   4  Read
Printer    8  Write
RS-232     5  Concurrent read
serial     8  Block write
port       9  Concurrent write
          13  Concurrent read & write

              Clear     Text    Read
              Screen    Window  Oper-
              after GR. also    ation
              --------  ----    -----
Screen     8  yes       no      no
display   12  yes       no      yes
(S:)      24  yes       yes     no
          28  yes       yes     yes
          40  no        no      no
          44  no        no      yes
          56  no        yes     no
          60  no        yes     yes

Note that with S:, the screen is
always cleared in GR.0 and there is
no separate text window in GR.0
unless specifically user- designed.
Without the screen clear, the
previous material will remain on
screen between GRAPHICS mode
changes, but will not be legible in
other modes. The values with S: are
placed in the first auxiliary byte
of the IOCB. All of the screen
values above are also a write
operation.

The second parameter in an OPEN
statement (placed in the second
auxiliary byte) is far more
restricted in its use. Usually set
to zero. If set to 128 ($80) for the
cassette, it changes from normal to
short inter-record gaps (AUX2).

With the Atari 820 printer, 83 ($53;
AUX byte two) means sideways
characters (Atari 820 printer only).
Other printer variables (all for
AUX2 as well) are: 70 ($4E) for
normal 40 character per line
printing and 87 ($57) for wide
printing mode.  With the screen
(S:), a number can be used to
specify the GRAPHICS modes zero
through eleven. If mode zero is
chosen, then the AUX1 options as
above are ignored.  For the ICCOM
field, the following values apply
(BASIC XIO commands use the same
values):

Command              Dec Hex
---------------------------------
Open channel           3 3
Get text record
  (line)               5 5  BASIC:
                            INPUT
                            #n,A
Get binary record      7 7  BASIC:
  (buffer)                  GET #n,A 
Put text record        9 9
  (line)
Put binary record     11 B  BASIC:
  (buffer)                  PUT #n,A
Close                 12 C
Dynamic (channel)     13 D
   status

BASIC uses a special "put byte"
vector in the IOCB to talk directly
to the handler for the PRINT#n,A$
command.  Disk File Management
System Commands (BASIC XIO command):

Rename                32 20
Erase (delete)        33 21
Protect (lock)        35 23
Unprotect (unlock)    36 24
Point                 37 25
Note                  38 26
Format               254 FE

In addition, XIO supports the
following commands:

Get character          7 7
Put character         11 B
Draw line             17 11   Display
                              handler
                              only.
Fill area             18 12   Display
                              handler
                              only.

FILL is done in BASIC with XIO
18,#6,12,0,"S:" (see the BASIC
Reference Manual for details).

For the RS-232 (R:), XIO supports:

Output partial block  32 20
Control RTS,XMT,DTR   34 22
Baud, stop bits,      36 24
  word size 
Translation mode      38 26
Concurrent mode       40 28

(see the 850 Interface Manual for
details)

CIO treats any command byte value
greater than 13 ($D) as a special
case, and transfers control over to
the device handler for processing.

Atari" columns in COMPUTE!, November
and December 1981, and in
