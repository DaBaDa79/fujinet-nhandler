1801          0709          SABYTE

This records the limit on the number
of files that can be open
simultaneously. Usually set to
three, the maximum is seven (one for
each available IOCB -- remember
IOCB0 is used for the screen
display). Each available file takes
128 bytes for a buffer, if you
increase the number of buffers, you
decrease your RAM space accordingly.
You can POKE 1801 with your new
number to increase or decrease the
number of files and then rewrite DOS
(by calling DOS from BASIC and
choosing menu selection "H") and
have this number as your default on
the new DOS.
