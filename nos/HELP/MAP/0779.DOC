Write verify flag for disk I/O
operations. POKE with 80 ($50) to
turn off the verify function, 87
($57) to turn it back on. Disk write
without verify is faster, but you
may get errors in your data. I have
had very few errors generated by
turning off the verify function, but
even one error in critical material
can destroy a whole program. Be
careful about using this location.
You can save DOS (as above with menu
selection "H") without write verify
as your new default by writing DOS
to a new disk. See the DOS Manual,
page F.85. K-DOS's write-verify flag
is located at 1907 ($773).
