Entry point to a 21-byte FMS device
(disk) handler. The address of this
handler is placed in HATABS
(locations 794 to 831; $31A to $33F)
by the FMS initialization routine.
When CIO needs to call an FMS
function, it will locate the address
of that function via the handler
address table. See Chapters 8-11 of
Inside Atari DOS, published by
COMPUTE! Books.
