3818          0EEA        ....

By POKEing 3818 with 33 and 3822
with 123 ($21 ,$7B;), you can modify
DOS to accept file names with
punctuation, numbers and lowercase
as valid; 33 is the low range of the
ATASCII code and 127 the high range
(lower or higher values are control
and graphics codes and inverse
characters). Of course, any
unmodified DOS still won't accept
such file names. You could actually
change the range to any value from
zero to 255 at your discretion.
This, however, may cause other
problems with such ATASCII codes as
spaces and the wildcard (*; see
above). Can be saved back to disk
with menu selection "H".
