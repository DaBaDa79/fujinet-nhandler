Disk directory (VTOC -- Volume Table
Of Contents) buffer. 64 ($40) bytes
are reserved, one byte for each
possible file. It also marks the end
of FMS. The VTOC (sector 360; $168)
is a sequential bit map of each of
the 720 sectors on the disk. It
starts at byte ten and continues
through to byte 99. When a bit is
set (one), it indicates that the
sector associated is in use.
