The MEM.SAV (MEMSAVE) file creation
routines begin here.  They start
with the file name MEM.SAV stored in
ATASCII format. The write routines
begin at MWRITE, 5958 ($1746). The
DOS utility MEMSAVE copies the lower
6000 bytes of memory to disk to save
your BASIC program from being
destroyed when you call DOS, which
then loads DUP.SYS into that area of
memory.
