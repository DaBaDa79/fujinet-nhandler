MEMLO (743, 744; $2E7, $2E8) points
here when DOS is resident unless the
buffer allocation has been altered.
MEMLO will point to 7164 for a one
drive, two data buffer setup, a
saving of 256 bytes. Loading the
RS-232 handler from the 850
Interface will move MEMLO up another
1728 bytes. The RS-232 handler in
the 850 Interface will only boot
(load into memory) if you first boot
the AUTORUN.SYS file on your Atari
master diskette or use another
RS-232 boot program such as a
terminal package. The RS-232 handler
will boot up into memory if you do
not have a disk attached and you
have turned it on before turning on
the computer. You may still use the
printer (parallel) port on the 850
even if the RS-232 handler is not
booted.
