Format the entire disk. There is no
way to format specific sectors of a
disk with the "C" ROMs currently
used in your 810 drives.  There is a
new ROM, the "E" version, which not
only allows selective sector
formatting, but is also considerably
faster. It was not known at the time
of this writing whether Atari would
release the "E" version.
