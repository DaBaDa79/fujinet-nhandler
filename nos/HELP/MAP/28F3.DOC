10483          28F3          TESTVER2

Test for version two DOS. DOS.20S is
the latest official DOS,
considerably improved over the
earlier DOS 1.0. The S stands for
single density. Atari had planned to
release a dual density drive (the
815), but pulled it out of the
production line at the last minute
for some obscure high-level reason.
A double density drive is available
from the Percom company.
