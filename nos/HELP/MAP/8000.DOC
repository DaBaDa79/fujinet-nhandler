CARTRIDGE B: 8K

Locations 32768 to 40959 ($8000 to
$9FFF) are used by the right cart-
ridge (Atari 800 only), when present.
When not present, this RAM area is
available for use in programs. When
the 8K BASIC cartridge is being used,
this area most frequently contains
the display list and screen memory.
As of this writing, the only cart-
ridge that uses this slot is Monkey
Wrench from Eastern House Software.

It is possible to have 16K cartridges
on the Atari by either combining both
slots using two 8K cartridges or
simply having one with large enough
ROM chips and using one slot. In this
case, the entire area from 32768 to
49151 ($8000 to $BFFF) would be used
as cartridge ROM.

Technically, the right cartridge slot
is checked first for a resident
cartridge and initialized, then the
left. You can confirm this by putting
the Assembler Editor cartridge in the
right and BASIC in the left slots.
BASIC will boot, but not the ASED.
Using FRE(0), you will see, however,
that you have 8K less RAM to use; and
PEEKing through this area will show
that the ASED program is indeed in
memory, but that control was passed
to BASIC. Control will pass to the
ASED cartridge if the cartridges are
reversed. This is because the last
six bytes of the cartridge programs
tell the OS where the program begins
-- in both cases, it is a location in
the area dedicated to the left cart-
ridge.

The six bytes are as follows:

Byte          Purpose
Right(B)
40954 ($9FFA) Cartridge start address
  (low byte)
40955 ($9FFB) Cartridge start address
  (high byte)
40956,($9FFC) Reads zero if a
  cartridge is inserted, non-zero when
  no cartridge is present. This
  information is passed down to the
  page zero RAM: if the A cartridge is
  plugged in, then location 6 will
  read one; if the B cartridge is 
  plugged in, then location 7 will 
  read one; otherwise they will read 
  zero.
40957 ($9FFD) Option byte. If BIT 0
  equals one, then boot the disk (else
  there is no disk boot). If BIT 2
  equals one, then initialize and 
  start the cartridge (else initialize
  but do not start). If BIT 7 equals 
  one, then the cartridge is a 
  diagnostic cartridge which will take
  control, but not initialize the OS 
  (else non-diagnostic cartridge). 
  Diagnostic cartridges were used by 
  Atari in the development of the 
  system and are not available to the
  public.
40958 ($9FFE) Cartridge initialization
  address low byte.
40959 ($9FFF) Cartridge initialization
  address high byte. This is the 
  address to which the OS will jump 
  during all powerup and RESETs.

The OS makes temporary use of
locations 36876 to 36896 ($900C to
$9020) to set up vectors for the
interrupt handler. See the OS list-
ings pages 31 and 81. This code was
only used in the development system
used to design the Atari.
