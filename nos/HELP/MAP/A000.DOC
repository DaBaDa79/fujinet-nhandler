CARTRIDGE A: 8K

Byte          Purpose
Left (A)
49146 ($BFFA) Cart start addr (low)
49147 ($BFFB) Cart start addr (high)
49148 ($BFFC) Reads 0 if a cartridge
  is inserted, non-zero when no cart-
  ridge is present. This information
  is passed down to the page 0 RAM:
  if the A cartridge is plugged in,
  then location 6 will read one;
  if the B cartridge is plugged in,
  then location 7 will read one;
  otherwise they will read zero.
49149 ($BFFD) Option byte.
  If BIT 0 equals one, then boot
  the disk (else there is no disk
  boot).
  If BIT 2 equals one, then init-
  ialize and start the cartridge
  (else initialize but do not start).
  If BIT 7 equals one,
  then the cartridge is a diagnostic
  cartridge which will take control,
  but not initialize the OS (else
  non-diagnostic cartridge). Diag-
  nostic cartridges were used by
  Atari in the development of the
  system and are not available to
  the public.
49150 ($BFFE) Cart init addr lo byte
49151 ($BFFF) Cart init addr hi byte.
  This is the address to which the OS
  will jump during all powerup and
  RESETs.

Locations 40960 to 49151 ($A000 to
$BFFF) are used by the left cartridge,
when present. When not present, this
RAM area is available for other use.
The display list and the screen
display data will be in this area
when there is no cartridge present.

Most cartridges use this slot (see
above) including the 8K BASIC,
Assembler-Editor, and many games.
Below are some of the entry points
for the routines in Atari 8K BASIC.
There is no official Atari listing of
the BASIC ROM yet. Many of the addr-
esses below are listed in Your Atari
400/800. Others have been provided in
numerous magazine articles and from
disassembling the BASIC cartridge.

10  IF NOT PEEK(ADDRESS) THEN PRINT:END
15  PRINT TOKEN,
20  BYTE = PEEK(ADDRESS): ADDRESS = ADDRESS + 1
30  IF BYTE < 128 THEN PRINT CHR$(BYTE);: GOTO 20
40  PRINT CHR$(BYTE - 128)
50  ADDRESS = ADDRESS + 2: TOKEN = TOKEN + 1: GOTO 10
