ANTIC is a special, separate
microprocessor used in your Atari to
control C/GTIA, the screen display,
and other screen-related functions
including processing the NMI
interrupts. It uses its own
instruction set, called the display
list, which tells ANTIC where to find
the screen data in RAM and how to
display it. ANTIC also uses an
internal four bit counter called the
Delta Counter (DCTR) to control the
vertical dimension of each block.
