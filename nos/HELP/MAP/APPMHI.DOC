14          000E          APPMHI

Applications memory high limit and
pointer to the end of your BASIC
program, used by both the OS and
BASIC. It contains the lowest address
you can use to set up a screen and
Display List (which is also the
highest address usable for programs
and data below which the display RAM
may not be placed). The screen handler
will not OPEN the "S:" device if it
would extend the screen RAM or the
Display List below this address;
memory above this address may be used
for the screen display and other data
(PM graphics, etc.).

If an attempted screen mode change
would extend the screen memory below
APPMHI, then the screen is set up for
GRAPHICS mode zero; MEMTOP (locations
741, 742; $2E5, $2E6) is updated and
an error is returned to the user.
Otherwise, the memory is not too small
for the screen editor; the mode change
will take effect and MEMTOP will be
updated. This is one of five locations
used by the OS to keep track of the
user and display memory.  Initialized
to zero by the OS at powerup.
Remember, you cannot set up a screen
display below the location specified
here.

If you use the area below the Display
List for your character sets, PM
graphics or whatever, be sure to set
APPMHI above the last address used so
that the screen or the DL data will
not descend and destroy your own data.
See RAMTOP location 106 ($6A), MEMTOP
at 741, 742 ($2E5, $2E6), PMBASE at
54279 ($D407) and CHBASE at 54281
($D409) for more information.

Locations 16 through 127 ($10-$7F) are
cleared on either cold- or warmstart.
