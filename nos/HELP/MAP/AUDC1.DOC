(W) Audio channel one control. Each
AUDF register has an associated
control register which sets volume
and distortion levels.  The bit
assignment is:

            Bits
-----------------------------
 7  6  5     4    3  2  1  0
Distortion Volume    Volume
  (noise)   only     level
 0  0  0     0    0  0  0  0 Lowest
 0  0  1          0  0  0  1
 etc. to:           etc. to:
 1  1  1     1    1  1  1  1 Highest
          (forced
           output)

The values for the distortion bits
are as follows. The first process is
to divide the clock value by the
frequency, then mask the output
using the polys in the order below.
Finally, the result is divided by
two.

Bit
7    6    5
0    0    0  5 bit, then 17 bit,polys
0    0    1  5 bit poly only
0    1    0  5 bit, then 4 bit, polys
0    1    1  5 bit poly only
1    0    0  17 bit poly only
1    0    1  no poly counters (pure
             tone)
1    1    0  4 bit poly only
1    1    1  no poly counters (pure
             tone)

In general, the tones become more
regular (a recognizable droning
becomes apparent) with fewer and
lower value polys masking the
output. This is all the more obvious
at low frequency ranges. POKE with
160 ($A0) or 224 ($E0) plus the
volume for pure tones.

Manual for details.
