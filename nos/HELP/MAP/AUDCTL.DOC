53768          D208          AUDCTL

(W) Audio control. To properly
initialize the POKEY sound
capabilities, POKE AUDCTL with zero
and POKE 53775,3 ($D20F). These two
are the equivalent of the BASIC
statement SOUND 0,0,0,0. AUDCTL is the
option byte which affects all sound
channels. This bit assignment is:

Bit    Description:
7      Makes the 17 bit poly counter
       into nine bit poly (see below)
6      Clock channel one with 1.79 MHz
5      Clock channel three with 1.79
       MHz
4      Join channels two and one (16
       bit)
3      Join channels four and three
       (16 bit)
2      Insert high pass filter into
       channel one, clocked by channel
       two
1      Insert high pass filter into
       channel two, clocked by channel
       four
0      Switch main clock base from 64
       KHz to 15 KHz

Poly (polynomial) counters are used as
a source of random pulses for noise
generation. There are three polys:
four, five and 17 bits long. The
shorter polys create repeatable sound
patterns, while the longer poly has no
apparent repetition. Therefore,
setting BIT 7 above, making the 17-bit
into a nine-bit poly will make the
pattern in the distortion more
evident. You chose which poly(s) to
use by setting the high three bits in
the AUDC registers. The 17-bit poly is
also used in the generation of random
numbers; see 53770 ($D20A).

The clock bits allow the user to speed
up or slow down the clock timers,
respectively, making higher or lower
frequency ranges possible. Setting the
channels to the 1.79 MHz will produce
a much higher sound, the 64 KHz clock
will be lower, and the 15 KHz clock
the lowest. The clock is also used
when setting the frequency for the
AUDF timers.

Two bits (three and four) allow the
user to combine channels one and two
or three and four for what amounts to
a nine octave range instead of the
usual five. Here's an example from De
Re Atari of this increased range,
which uses two paddles to change the
frequency: the right paddle makes
coarse adjustments, the left paddle
makes fine adjustments:

10 SOUND 0,0,0,0:POKE 53768,80:REM SET CLOCK AND JOIN CHANNELS 1 AND 2
20 POKE 53761,160:POKE 53763,168:REM TURN OFF CHANNEL 1 AND SET 2 TO PURE TONE GENERATION
50 POKE 53760,PADDLE(0):POKE 53762,PADDLE(1):GOTO 30

High pass filters allow only
frequencies higher than the clock
value to pass through. These are
mostly used for special effects.

Try:

10 SOUND 0,0,0,0:POKE 53768,4:REM HIGH PASS FILTER ON CHANNEL 1
20 POKE 53761,168:POKE 53765,168:REM PURE TONES
30 POKE 53760,254:POKE 53764,127
40 GOTO 40

See the excellent chapter on sound in
De Re Atari: it is the best
explanation of sound functions in the
Atari available. See also the Hardware
Manual for complete details.

              ALLPOT

(R) Eight line pot port state; reads
all of the eight POTs together.  Each
bit represents a pot (paddle) of the
same number. If a bit is set to zero,
then the register value for that pot
is valid (it's in use); if it is one,
then the value is not valid. ALLPOT is
used with the POTGO command at 53771
($D20B).
