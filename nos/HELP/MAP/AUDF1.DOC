53760          D200          AUDF1

(W) Audio channel one frequency. This
is actually a number (N) used in a
"divide by N circuit"; for every N
pulses coming in (as set by the POKEY
clock), one pulse goes out. As N gets
larger, output pulses will decrease,
and thus the sound produced will be a
lower note. N can be in the range from
one to 256; POKEY adds one to the
value in the AUDF register. See BYTE,
April 1982, for a program to create
chords instead of single tones.

              POT0

(R) Pot (paddle) 0 (624); pot is short
for potentiometer. Turning the paddle
knob clockwise results in decreasing
pot values. For machine language use:
these pot values are valid only 228
scan lines after the POTGO command or
after ALLPOT changes (see 53768; $D208
and 53771; $D20B). POT registers
continually count down to zero,
decrementing every scan line. They are
reset to 228 when they reach zero or
by the values read from the shadow
registers. This makes them useful as
system timers. See COMPUTE!, February
1982, for an example of this use.

The POTGO sequence (see 53771; $D20B)
resets the POT registers to zero, then
reads them 228 scan lines later. For
the fast pot scan, BIT 2 of SKCTL at
53775 ($D20F) must be set.
