Blackboard mode entry. Blackboard mode
is the "ATARI MEMO PAD" mode. It can
be reached from BASIC by typing "BYE",
"B." or by powering up with no
peripherals or cartridges.  Nothing
you write to the screen in blackboard
mode is acted upon by the computer.
You can enter this mode to protect
your programs temporarily from prying
and curious fingers.

All of the screen editing commands
continue to work in blackboard mode.
You can enter blackboard mode from any
graphics mode with a text window; the
display screen will remain intact on
the screen while the text window will
be in blackboard mode. Pressing RESET
will, of course, return the entire
screen to GR.0. You can also enter
blackboard mode from a program, but
cannot get out of it in BASIC once you
are in it.

If you entered blackboard mode from
BASIC, you can return to it by
pressing RESET. Any BASIC program will
still be there. So will any RS-232 or
DOS handlers previously booted.
Initialized to 61987 ($F223).
