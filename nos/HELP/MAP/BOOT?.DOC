9          0009          BOOT?

Boot flag success indicator. A value
of 255 in this location will cause the
system to lockup if RESET is pressed.
If BOOT? reads one, then the disk boot
was successful; if it reads two, then
the cassette boot was successful. If
it reads zero, then neither peripheral
was booted.

If it is set to two, then the cassette
vector at locations two and three will
be used on RESET. Set to one, it will
use the DOS vector at 10 and 11 ($A
and $B). Coldstart attempts both a
cassette and a disk boot and flags
this location with the success or
failure of the boots. BOOT? is checked
during both disk and cassette boot.
