703          02BF          BOTSCR

Flag for the number of text rows
available for printing. 24 ($18) is
normal for text mode GR.0; four for
the text window, zero for all graphics
modes. In all GRAPHICS modes except
zero, if there is no text window then
703 will also read zero. The
large-text displays in GR.1 and GR.2
are treated as graphics displays for
this purpose. The display handler
specifically checks for split- screen
mode by looking for the variable 24 or
four here. If it finds 24 here, it
assumes there is no text window; if
not, it looks for the variable four.

You can add a text window to GR.0 by
POKEing here with four.  The top
portion (20 lines) of the screen will
not scroll with the bottom. To write
to the top part of the screen you will
have to use the PRINT#6 statement as
with modes one and two. One possible
application of this would be to keep a
fixed menu at the top of the screen
while scrolling the bottom part, as
done with the DOS menu.
