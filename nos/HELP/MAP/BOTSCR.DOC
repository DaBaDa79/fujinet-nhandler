703          02BF          BOTSCR

Flag for the number of text rows
available for printing. 24 ($18) is
normal for text mode GR.0; four for
the text window, zero for all
graphics modes. In all GRAPHICS
modes except zero, if there is no
text window then 703 will also read
zero. The large-text displays in
GR.1 and GR.2 are treated as
graphics displays for this purpose.
The display handler specifically
checks for split- screen mode by
looking for the variable 24 or four
here. If it finds 24 here, it
assumes there is no text window; if
not, it looks for the variable four.

You can add a text window to GR.0 by
POKEing here with four.  The top
portion (20 lines) of the screen
will not scroll with the bottom. To
write to the top part of the screen
you will have to use the PRINT#6
statement as with modes one and two.
One possible application of this
would be to keep a fixed menu at the
top of the screen while scrolling
the bottom part, as done with the
DOS menu.

-------------------------------------
Locations 704 to 712 ($2C0 to $2C8)
are the color registers for players,
missiles, and playfields. These are
the RAM shadow registers for
locations 53266 to 53274 ($D012 to
$D01A). For the latter, you can use
the SETCOLOR command from BASIC. For
all registers you can POKE the
desired color into the location by
using this formula:

COLOR = HUE * 16 + LUMINANCE

It is possible to get more colors in
GR.8 than the one (and a half) that
Atari says is possible by using a
technique called artifacting. There
is a small example of artifacting
shown at location 710 ($2C6). See De
Re Atari, Your Atari 400/800,
Creative Computing, June 1981, and
COMPUTE!, May 1982.

Here are the 16 colors the Atari
produces, along with their POKE
values for the color registers. The
POKE values assume a luminance of
zero. Add the luminance value to the
numbers to brighten the color.  The
color registers ignore BIT 0; that's
why there are no "odd" values for
luminance, just even values.

COLOR             VALUE
Black           0,      0
Rust            1,     16
Red-orange      2,     32
Dark orange     3,     48
Red             4,     64
Dk lavender     5,     80
Cobalt blue     6,     96
Ultramarine     7,    112
Medium blue     8,    128
Dark blue       9,    144
Blue-grey      10,    160
Olive green    11,    176
Medium green   12,    192
Dark green     13,    208
Orange-green   14,    224
Orange         15,    240

The bit use of the PCOLR and COLOR
registers is as follows:

Bit     7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
        --color--   luminance unused
Grey    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  Darkest
Rust    0  0  0  1  0  0  1
           etc. to:      etc. to:
Orange  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  Lightest

When you enable the color overlap at
location 623 ($26F), ANTIC performs
a logical OR on the overlap areas.
For example:

         01000010 Red, luminance two
      OR 10011010 Darkblue,lumin ten
         --------
Result = 10011010 Dark green, lum ten

Here's a short machine language
routine which will rotate the colors
in registers 705 to 712:

10   DIM ROT$(30)
20   FOR LOOP = 1 TO 27: READ BYTE: ROT$(LOOP,LOOP) = CHR$(BYTE): NEXT LOOP
.
.    PUT YOUR GRAPHICS ROUTINE HERE
.
100  CHANGE = USR(ADR(ROT$))
105  FOR LOOP = 1 TO 200: NEXT LOOP:GOTO 100
110  DATA 104,162,0,172,193,2,189,194,2,157
120  DATA 193,2,232,224,8,144,245,140,200,2
130  DATA  96,65,65,65,65,65,65

If you wish to rotate the colors in
registers 704 to 711 instead, change
lines 110 and 120 to read as follows:

110  DATA 104,162,0,172,192,2,189,193,2,157
120  DATA 192,2,232,224,8,144,245,140,199,2

If you wish to include all of the
registers 704 to 712 in the routine,
make the changes as above and change
the eight in line 120 to nine and
restore the 199 to 200 in line 120.
This routine works well with the
GTIA demos at location 623 ($26F).

Atari BASIC Reference Manual, pp.
45-56, and the GTIA Demo Disk from
APX.
