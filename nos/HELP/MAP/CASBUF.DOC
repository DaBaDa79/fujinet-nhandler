CASBUF

Cassette buffer. These locations are
used by the cassette handler to read
data from and write data to the
program (tape) recorder.  The 128
($80) data bytes for each cassette
record are stored beginning at 1024
($400 - page four). The current buffer
size is found in location 650 ($28A).
Location 61 ($3D) points to the
current byte being written or read.
CASBUF is also used in the disk boot
process; the first disk record is read
into this buffer.

A cassette record consists of 132
bytes: two control bytes set to 85
($55; alternating zeros and ones) for
speed measurement in the baud rate
correction routine; one control byte
(see below); 128 data bytes (compared
to 125 data bytes for a disk sector),
and a checksum byte. Only the data
bytes are stored in the cassette
buffer. See De Re Atari for more
~nformaUon on the cassette recorder.


CONTROL BYTE VALUES

Value      Meaning
250 ($FA)  Partial record follows. The
actual number of bytes is stored in
the last byte of the record (127).
252 ($FC)  Record full; 128 bytes
follow.
254 ($FE)  End of File (EOF) record;
followed by 128 zero bytes.

---------------------------------------
Locations 1152 to 1791 ($480 to $6FF)
are for user RAM (outer environment)
requirements, depending on the amount
of RAM available in the machine.
Provided you don't use the FP package
or BASIC, you have 640 ($280) free
bytes here.  Locations 1152 to 1279
($480 to $4FF) are 128 ($80) spare
bytes.  The floating point package,
when used, requires locations 1406 to
1535 ($57E to $5FF).
