Cassette initialization vector: JSR
through here if the cassette boot was
successful. This address is extracted
from the first six bytes of a cassette
boot file. The first byte is ignored.
The second contains the number of
records, the third and fourth contain
the low and high bytes of the load
address, and the fifth and sixth
contain the low and high bytes of the
initialization address.  Control upon
loading jumps to the load address plus
six for a multi-stage load and through
CASINI for initialization. JSR through
DOSVEC (10 and 11; $A,$B) to transfer
control to the application.
