Routines for the cassette handler.

The buzz used in the cassette CLOAD
command can be called up from BASIC
by:

BUZZ = USR(61530).

You can turn it off with the RESET
key. While this isn't terribly
exciting, it points to the potential
of using the console speaker for
sound instead of merely for beeps
(the RAM location for the speaker is
at 53279; $D01F). See the speaker
location and COMPUTE!, August 1981,
for a short routine to use the
speaker for sound effects.
