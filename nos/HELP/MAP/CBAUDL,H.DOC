Cassette baud rate low and high bytes.
Initialized to 1484 ($5CC), which
represents a nominal 600 baud (bits
per second).  After baud rate
calculations, these locations will
contain POKEY values for the corrected
baud rate. The baud rate is adjusted
by SIO to account for motor
variations, tape stretch, etc. The
beginning of every cassette record
contains a pattern of alternating
off/on bits (zero/one) which are used
solely for speed (baud) correction.
