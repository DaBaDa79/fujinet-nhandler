System timer one jump address,
initialized to 60400 ($EBF0).  When
locations 536, 537 ($218, $219)
reach (count down to) zero, the OS
vectors through here (jumps to the
location specified by these two
addresses). You can set your machine
code routine address here for
execution when timer one reaches
(counts down to) zero. Your code
should end with the RTS instruction.
 Problems may occur when timer
values are set greater than 255,
since the 6502 cannot manipulate
16-bit values directly (a number in
the range of zero to 255 is an
eight-bit value; if a value requires
two bytes to store, such as a memory
location, it is a 16-bit value).
Technically, a VBLANK interrupt
could occur when one timer byte is
being initialized and the other not
yet set.  To avoid this, keep timer
values less than 255. See the Atari
OS User's Manual, page 106, for
details.

Since the OS uses timer one, it is
recommended that you use timer two
instead, to avoid conflicts with the
operation of the Atari. Initialized
to 60396 ($EBEA) in the old ROMs,
60400 ($EBF0) in the new ROMs. NMI
