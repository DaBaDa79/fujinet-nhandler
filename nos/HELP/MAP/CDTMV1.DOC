System timer one value. Counts
backwards from 255. This SIO timer is
decremented every stage one VBLANK.
When it reaches zero, it sets a flag
to jump (JSR) through the address
stored in locations 550, 551 ($226,
$227). Only the realtime clock
(locations 18-20; $12-14), timer one,
and the attract mode register (77;
$4D) are updated when the VBLANK
routine is cut short because
time-critical code (location 66; $42
set to non-zero for critical code) is
executed by the OS. Since the OS uses
timer one for its I/O routines and for
timing serial bus operations (setting
it to different values for timeout
routines), you should use another
timer to avoid conflicts or
interference with the operation of the
system.
