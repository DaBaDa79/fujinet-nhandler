System timer three. Same as 538.
Timers three, four, and five are
stopped when the OS sets the CRITIC
flag to non-zero as well.  The OS uses
timer three to OPEN the cassette
recorder and to set the length of time
to read and write tape headers. Any
prior value in the register during
this function will be lost.
