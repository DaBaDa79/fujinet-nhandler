764          02FC          CH

Internal hardware value for the last
key pressed. POKE CH with 255 ($FF;
no key pressed) to clear it. The
keyboard handler gets all of its key
data from CH. It stores the value
255 here to indicate the key code
has been accepted, then passes the
code to CH1, location 754 ($2F2). If
the value in CH is the same as in
CH1, a key code will be accepted
only if the proper key debounce
delay time has transpired. If the
code is the CTRL-1 combination (the
CTRL and the "1" keys pressed
simultaneously), then the start/stop
flag at 767 ($2FF) is complemented,
but the value is not stored in CH.
The auto repeat logic will also
store store key information here as
a result of the continuous pressing
of a key.  This is neither the
ATASCII nor the internal code value;
it is the "raw" keyboard matrix code
for the key pressed. The table for
translation of this code to ATASCII
is on page 50 of the OS User's
Manual. In a two-key operation, BIT
7 is set if the CTRL key is pressed,
BIT 6 if the SHIFT key is pressed.
The rest of the bytes are the code
(ignored if both BITs 7 and 6 are
set). Only the code for the last key
pressed is stored here (it is a
global variable for keyboard).

When a read request is issued to the
keyboard, CH is set to 255 by the
handler routine. After a keycode has
been read from this register, it is
reset to 255. BREAK doesn't show
here, and CTRL and SHIFT will not
show here on their own. However, the
inverse toggle (Atari logo key),
CAPS/LOWR, TAB and the ESC keys will
show by themselves. You can examine
this register with:

10 LOOK=PEEK(764)
20 PRINT "KEY PRESSED = ";LOOK
30 POKE 764,255
40 FOR LOOP=1 TO 250:NEXT LOOP
50 GOTO 10

See COMPUTE!'s First Book of Atari
for an example of using this
register as a replacement for
joystick input.
