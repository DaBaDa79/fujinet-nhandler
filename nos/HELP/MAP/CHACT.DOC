755          02F3          CHACT

Character Mode Register. Zero means
normal inverse characters, one is
blank inverse characters (inverse
characters will be printed as blanks,
i.e., invisible), two is normal
characters, three is solid inverse
characters. Four to seven is the same
as zero to three, but prints the
display upside down.  This register
also controls the transparency of the
cursor. It is transparent with values
two and six, opaque with values three
and seven. The cursor is absent with
values zero, one, four and five.

Toggling BIT 0 on and off can be a
handy way to produce a blinking effect
for printed inverse characters
(characters with ATASCII values
greater than 128 -- those that have
BIT 7 set).  Shadow for 54273 ($D401).
There is no visible cursor for the
graphics mode output. CHACT is
initialized to two.  Here's an example
of blinking text using this register:

10 CHACT=755:REM USE INVERSE FOR WORDS BELOW
15 PRINT "[THIS IS A TEST OF BLINKING] [TEXT]"
20 POKE CHACT,INT(RND(0)*4)
30 FOR N=1 TO 100:NEXT N:GOTO 15

See COMPUTE!, December 1981.

Using a machine language routine and
page six space, try:

10 PAGE=1536:EXIT=1568
20 FOR N=PAGE TO EXIT:READ BYTE:POKE N,BYTE:NEXT N
30 PGM=USR(PAGE)
40 PRINT "[THIS] IS A [TEST] OF [BLINKING] TEXT":REM MAKE SOME WORDS INVERSE
50 GOTO 50
60 DATA 104,169,17,141,40,2,169,6,141,41
70 DATA 2,169,30,141,26,2,98,173,243,2
80 DATA 41,1,73,1,141,243,2,169,30,141,26,2,96

The blink frequency is set .5 second;
to change it, change the 30 in line 80
to any number from one (1/30 second)
to 255 (eight .5 seconds). For another
way to make the cursor visible or
invisible, see locations 752 above.
