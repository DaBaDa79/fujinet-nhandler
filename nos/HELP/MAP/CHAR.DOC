762          02FA          CHAR

Internal code value for the most
recent character read or written
(internal code for the value in ATACHR
below). This register is difficult to
use with PEEK statements since it
returns the most recent character;
most often the cursor value (128, $80
for a visible, zero for an invisible
cursor).
