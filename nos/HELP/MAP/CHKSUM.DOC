Data frame checksum used by SIO:
single byte sum with carry to the
least significant bit. Checksum is the
value of the number of bytes
transmitted (255; $FF). When the
number of transmitted bytes equals the
checksum, a checksum sent flag is set
at location 59 ($3B). Uses locations
53773 ($D20D) and 56 ($38) for
comparison of values (bytes
transmitted).
