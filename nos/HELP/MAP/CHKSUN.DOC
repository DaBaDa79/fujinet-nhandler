According to Softside Magazine, 
December 1981, if a PEEK here returns
255, then you have the older OS 
ROM(s). There were some troubles with
cassette loads in the older ROMs that
sometimes require the following to
cure:

Do an LPRINT without a printer 
attached before CLOAD. This clears
the cassette buffer.

Press RESET before CSAVEing or 
CLOADing will restore the system to 
its initialization parameters and 
help with loading and saving 
routines.

There is a new OS available from
Atari which fixes a bug that would
cause the I/O operations to "time
out" for a few seconds. It apparently
does not alter any of the routines
mentioned here.

The chip reset interrupt (powerup)
vectors through location 65532 
($FFFC) to 58487 ($E477) where a JMP
vector to the powerup routine is
located. A chip reset is not the same
as pressing the RESET key, which in
itself does not generate a chip 
reset.

The NMI interrupts are vectored
through 65530 ($FFFA) to the NMI
service routine (ISR) at 59316
($E7B4), and all IRQ interrupts are
vectored through 65534 ($FFFE) to the
IRQ service routine at 59123 ($E6F3).
In these service routine areas, the
cause of the interrupt is determined,
and the appropriate action is taken,
either by the OS or through a JMP to
a RAM vector where a user routine
exists.
