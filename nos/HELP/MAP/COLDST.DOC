580          0244          COLDST

Coldstart flag. Zero is normal, if
zero, then pressing RESET will not
result in reboot. If POKEd with one
(powerup in progress flag), the
computer will reboot whenever the
RESET key is pressed. Any non-zero
number indicates the initial powerup
routine is in progress.

If you create an AUTORUN.SYS file,
it should end with an RTS
instruction. If not, it should POKE
580 with zero and POKE 9 with one.
You can turn any binary file that
boots when loaded with DOS menu
selection "L" into an auto-boot file
simply by renaming it "AUTORUN.SYS".
Be careful not to use the same name
for any two files on the same disk.

When this is combined with the
disabling of the BREAK key discussed
in location 16 ($10) and the program
protection scheme discussed in
location 138 ($8A), you have the
means to protect your BASIC software
fairly effectively from being LISTed
or examined, although not from being
copied.
