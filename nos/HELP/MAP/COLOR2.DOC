710          02C6          COLOR2

The same as above for playfield two;
in GR.1 and GR.2, this register
stores the color of the inverse
uppercase letters. Shadow for 53272
($D018). Used for the background
color in GR.0 and GR.8. Both use
COLOR1 for the luminance value.

Despite the official limitations of
color selection in GR.8, it is
possible to generate additional
colors by "artifacting", turning on
specific pixels (.5 color clock
each) on the screen. Taking
advantage of the physical structure
of the TV set itself, we selectively
turn on vertical lines of pixels
which all show the same color. For
example:

10  A = 40: B = 30: C = 70: D = 5: F
= 20:GRAPHICS 8: POKE 87,7: P0KE
710,0: POKE 709,15: COLOR 1
30  PLOT A,D: DRAWTO A,C: COLOR 2:
PLOT F,D: DRAWTO F,C:
40  PLOT A + 1,D: DRAWTO A + 1,C
50  COLOR 3: PLOT B,D: DRAWTO B,C
60  GOTO 60

A little experimentation with this
will show you that the colors
obtained depend on which pixels are
turned on and how close together the
pixel columns are. There are four
"colors" you can obtain, as shown
before. Pixels marked one are on;
marked zero means they are off. Each
pair of pixels is one color clock.
Three color clocks are shown
together for clarity:

00:01:00 = color A 00:11:00 = color B
00:10:00 = color C 00:01:10 = color D
