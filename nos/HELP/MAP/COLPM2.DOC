(W) Color and luminance of player and
missile 2 (706).

              PAL

(R) Used to determine if the Atari is
PAL (European and Israeli TV
compatible when BITs 1 - 3 equal zero)
or NTSC (North American compatible
when BITs 1 - 3 equal one; 14 decimal,
$E).  European Ataris run 12% slower
if tied to the VBLANK cycle (the PAL
VBLANK cycle is every 50th second
rather than every 60th second). They
use only one CPU clock at three MHZ,
so the 6502 runs at 2.217 MHZ -- 25%
faster than North American Ataris.
Also, their $E000 and $F000 ROMs are
different, so there are possible
incompatibilities with North American
Ataris in the cassette handling
routines. There is a third TV standard
called SECAM, used in France, the
USSR, and parts of Africa. I am
unaware if there is any Atari support
for SECAM standards.

PAL TV has more scan lines per frame,
312 compared to 262.  NTSC Ataris
compensate by adding extra lines at
the beginning of the VBLANK routine.
Display lists do not have to be
altered, and colors are the same
because of a hardware modification.
