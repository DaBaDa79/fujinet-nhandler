53279          D01F          CONSOL

(W/R) Used to see if one of the three
yellow console buttons has been
pressed (not the RESET button!). To
clear the register, POKE CONSOL with
eight. POKEing any number from zero to
eight will cause a click from the
speaker. A FOR-NEXT loop that
alternately POKEs CONSOL with eight
and zero or just zero, since the OS
put in an 8 every 1/60 second, will
produce a buzz.  Values PEEKed will
range from zero to seven according to
the following table:

|Key  Value 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  |
|                                   |
+-----------------------------------+
|                                   |
|OPTION     X  X  X  X              |
|SELECT     X  X        X  X        |
|START      X     X     X     X     |
|                                   |
+-----------------------------------+
Bits 2      0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1
     1      0  0  1  1  0  0  1  1
     0      0  1  0  1  0  1  0  1

Where zero means all keys have been
pressed, one means OPTION and SELECT
have been pressed, etc., to seven,
which means no keys have been pressed.
CONSOL is updated every stage two
VBLANK procedure with the value eight.

It is possible to use the console
speaker to generate different sounds.
Here is one idea based on an article
in COMPUTE!, August 1981:

10   GOSUB 1000
20   TEST = USR(1536)
.
.
.
999  END
1000 FOR LOOP = 0 TO 26: READ BYTE: POKE 1536 + LOOP, BYTE: NEXT LOOP: RETURN
1010 DATA 104,162,255,169,255,141,31,208,169
1020 DATA 0,160,240,136,208,253,141,31,208,160
1030 DATA 240,136,208,253,202,208,233,96

To change the tone, you POKE 1547 and
1555 with a higher or lower value
(both are set to 240 above). To change
the tone duration, you POKE 1538 with
a lower value (it is set to 255 in the
routine above). Do these before you do
your USR call or alter the DATA
statements to permanently change the
values in your own program. Turn off
DMA (see location 559) to get clearer
tones.

---------------------------------------
Locations 53280 to 53503 ($D020 to
$D0FF) are repeats of locations 53248
to 53279 ($D000 to $D01F). You can't
use any of the repeated locations;
consider them "filler." They maybe
used for other purposes in any Atari
OS upgrade.

---------------------------------------
Locations 53504 to 53759 ($D100 to
$D1FF) are unused. These loca- tions
are not empty; you can PEEK into them
and find out what's there. They
cannot, however, be user-altered.
