TOPIC: MAP/COUNTR

126          007E          COUNTR

Starts out containing the larger
value of either DELTAR (location
118; $76) or DELTAC (location 119;
$77). This is the number of
iterations required to draw a line.
As each point on a line is drawn,
this value is decremented. When the
byte equals zero, the line is
complete (drawn).

-------------------------------------

User and/or BASIC page zero RAM
begins here. Locations 128 to 145
($80 to $91) are for BASIC program
pointers; 146 to 202 ($92 to $CA)
are for miscellaneous BASIC RAM; 203
to 209 ($CB to $D1) are unused by
BASIC, and 210 to 255 ($D2 to $FF)
are the floating point routine work
area. The Assembler Editor cartridge
uses locations 128 to 176 ($80 to
$B0) for its page zero RAM. Since
the OS doesn't use this area, you
are free to use it in any non-BASIC
or non-cartridge environment. If you
are using another language such as
FORTH, check that program's memory
map to see if any conflict will
occur.  See COMPUTE!'s First Book of
Atari, pages 26 to 53, for a
discussion of Atari BASIC structure,
especially that using locations 130
to 137 ($82 to $89). Included in the
tutorials are a memory analysis, a
line dump, and a renumber utility.
See also De Re Atari, BYTE, February
1982, and the locations for the
BASIC ROM 40960 to 49151 ($A000 to
$BFFF).
