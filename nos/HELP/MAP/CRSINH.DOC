Cursor inhibit flag. Zero turns the
cursor on; any other number turns the
cursor off. A visible cursor is an
inverse blank (space) character. Note
that cursor visibility does not change
until the next time the cursor moves
(if changed during a program). If you
wish to change the cursor status
without altering the screen data,
follow your CRSINH change with a
cursor movement (i.e., up, down)
sequence. This register is set to zero
(cursor restored) on powerup, RESET,
BREAK, or an OPEN command to either
the display handler (S:) or screen
editor (E:). See location 755 for
another means to turn off the cursor.
