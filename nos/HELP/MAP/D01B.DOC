(W) Priority selection register.
PRIOR establishes which objects on
the screen (players, missiles, and
playfields) will be in front of
other objects. Values used in this
register are also described at
location 623 ($26F), the shadow
register. If you use conflicting
priorities, objects whose priorities
are in conflict will turn black in
their overlap region.

Priority order (Decimal values in
brackets):

Bit 0 = 1 (1):            Bit 1 = 1
(2):
Player 0                  Player 0
Player 1                  Player 1
Player 2                  Playfield 0
Player 3                  Playfield 1
Playfield 0               Playfield 2
Playfield 1               Playfield

Bit 4 = 1: Enable a fifth player out
of the four missiles.
Bit 5 = 1: Overlap of players 0 and
1, 2 and 3 is third color (else
overlap is black). The resulting
color is a logical OR of the two
player colors.
Bits 6 and 7 are used to select GTIA
modes:
0     0 = no GTIA modes
0     1 = GTIA GR.9
1     0 = GTIA GR.10
1     1 = GTIA GR.11
