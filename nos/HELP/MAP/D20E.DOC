(W) Interrupt request enable. Zero
turns off all interrupt requests
such as the BREAK key; to disable or
re-enable interrupts, POKE with the
values according to the following
chart (setting a bit to one -- i.e.,
true -- enables that interrupt;
decimal values are also shown for
each bit):

Bit Dec Interrupt         Vector
0   1 |Timer 1           |VTIMR1
      |(counts down to 0)|(528; $210)
1   2 |Timer 2           |VTIMR2
      |(counts down to 0)|(530; $212)
2   4 |Timer 4           |
      |(counts down to 0)|VTIMR4
      |(OS B ROM only)   |(532; $214)
3   8 |Serial output     |VSEROC
      |transmission done |(526; $20E)
4   6 |Serial output     |VSEROR
      | data needed      (524; $20C)
5  32 |Serial input      |VSERIN
      |data ready        |(522; $20A)
6  64 |Other key pressed |VKEYBD
      |                  |(520; $208)
7 128 |BREAK key pressed |see below

Here is the procedure for the BREAK
key interrupt: clear the interrupt
register. Set BRKKEY (17; $11) to
zero; clear the start/stop flag
SSFLAG at 767 ($2FF); clear the
cursor inhibit flag CRSINH at 752
($2F0); clear the attract mode flag
at 77 ($4D), and return from the
interrupt after restoring the 6502 A
register. (There is now (in the OS
"B" ROMs) a proper vector for BREAK
key interrupts at 566, 567 ($236,
$237) which is initialized to point
to 59220 ($E754).) If the interrupt
was due to a serial I/O bus proceed
line interrupt, then vector through
VPRCED at 514 ($202). If due to a
serial I/O bus interrupt line
interrupt, then vector through
VINTER at 516 ($204). If due to a
6502 BRK instruction, then vector
through VBREAK at 518 ($206).

Timers relate to audio dividers of
the same number (an interrupt is
processed when the dividers count
down to zero). These bits in IRQEN
are not set on powerup and must be
initiated by the user program before
enabling the processor IRQ.

There	are two other interrupts,
processed by PIA, generated over the
serial bus Proceed and Interrupt
lines, set by the bits in the PACTL
and PBCTL registers (54018 and
54019; $D302, $D303):

Bit|Dec|Loc  |Interrupt
0  |  1|PACTL|Peripheral A (PORTA)
   |   |     |interrupt enable bit.
7  |128|PACTL|Peripheral A interrupt
   |   |     |status bit.
0  |  1|PBCTL|Peripheral B (PORTB)
   |   |     |interrupt enable bit.
7  |128|PBCTL|Peripheral B interrupt
   |   |     |status bit.

The latter PORT interrupts are
automatically disabled on powerup.
Only the BREAK key and data key
interrupts are enabled on powerup.
The shadow register is 16 ($10).

              IRQST

(R) Interrupt request status. Bit
functions are the same as IRQEN
except that they register the
interrupt request when it is zero
rather than the enable when a bit
equals one. IRQST is used to
determine the cause of interrupt
request with IRQEN, PACTL and PBCTL
as above.

All IRQ interrupts are normally
vectored through 65534 ($FFFE) to
the IRQ service routine at 59123
($E6F3), which determines the cause
of the interrupt. The IRQ global RAM
vector VIMIRQ at 534 ($216)
ordinarily points to the IRQ
processor at 59126 ($E6F6). The
processor then examines 53774
($D20E) and the PIA registers at
54018 and 54019 to determine the
interrupt cause. Once determined,
the routine vectors through one of
the IRQ RAM vectors in locations 514
to 526 ($202 to $20E). For
Non-Maskable Interrupts (NMI's), see
locations 54286 to 54287 ($D40E;
$D40F).  See the OS User's Manual
for complete details.
