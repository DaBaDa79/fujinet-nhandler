54016          D300          PORTA

(W/R) Reads or writes data from
controller jacks one and two if BIT
2 of PACTL (location 54018) is one.
Writes to direction control if BIT 2
of PACTL is zero.

These two port registers also
control the direction of data flow
to the port, if the controller
register (54018, below) is POKEd
with 48 ($30). Then, if the bits in
the register read zero, it is in
input (R) mode; if they read one, it
is in output (W) mode. A zero POKEd
here makes all bits input, a 255
($FF) makes all bits output. BITs 0
to 3 address pins one to four on
jack one, BITs 4 to 7 address pins
one to four on jack two. POKE 54018
with 52 to make this location into a
data register again. Shadow
registers are: STICK0 (632; $278,
jack one), STICK1 (633; $279, jack
two) and PTRIG0-3 (636-639;
$27C-$27F).

Bits used as data register
7    6    5    4    3    2    1    0
   --Jack 0---       --Jack 1---
   --Stick 1--       --Stick 0--

Forward  = BIT 0, 4 = 1
Backward = BIT 1, 5 = 1
Left     = BIT 2, 6 = 1
Right    = BIT 3, 7 = 1
Neutral  = All four jack bits = 1

PORTA is also used to test if the
paddle 0-3 triggers (PTRIG) have
been pressed, using these bits:

Bit   7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
PTRIG 3  2  -  -  1  0  -  -

Where zero in the appropriate bit
equals trigger pressed, one equals
trigger not pressed.

The PORT registers are also used in
the keyboard controller (used with a
keypad) operation where:

Bit   7   6   5   4   3   2   1  0
Row   4   3   2  Top  4   3   2 Top
Jack  ......2........ ......1........

Columns for the keyboard operation
are read through the POT (PADDL) and
TRIG registers. See Micro, May 1982,
and the Hardware Manual for more
information on jacks and ports.
