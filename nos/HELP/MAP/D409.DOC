(W) Character base address; the
location of the start of the
character set, either the standard
Atari set or a user-designed set.
The default is 224 ($E0), which
points to the start of the Atari ROM
character set. Iridis, a short-lived
disk -and- documentation magazine,
produced a good utility called
FontEdit to aid in the design of
altered character sets. Online
Systems' program The Next Step is
also very useful for this purpose,
as is COMPUTE!'s "SuperFont,"
January 1982. Uses shadow register
756 ($2F4).  Normally, this points
to location 57344 or 57856 ($E000 or
$E200) depending on your choice of
characters used in which text mode.
GRAPHICS mode zero uses the entire
128-character set; GR.1 and GR.2 use
only half the set (64 characters).
You POKE a different number into the
shadow register at 756 ($2F4) to
point to your own character set in
RAM. This must be an even number
that points to a page in memory that
is evenly divisible by two. In GR.1
and GR.2 this number is 224
(pointing to $E000), giving you
uppercase, punctuation and numbers.
POKEing the shadow or this location
(in machine language) with 226 will
give you lowercase and control
characters.

See the information about the ROM
character set at 57344 ($E000).
