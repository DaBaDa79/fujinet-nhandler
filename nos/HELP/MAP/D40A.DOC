54282          D40A          WSYNC

(W) Wait for horizontal
synchronization. Allows the OS to
synchronize the vertical TV display
by causing the 6502 to halt and
restart seven machine cycles before
the beginning of the next TV line.
It is used to synchronize the VBI's
or DLI's with the screen display.

To see the effect of the WSYNC
register, type in the second example
of a Display List Interrupt at
location 512. RUN it and observe
that it causes a clean separation of
the colors at the change boundary.
Now change line 50 to:

50  DATA 72,169,222,234,234,234,141,24,208,104,64

This eliminates the WSYNC command.
RUN it and see the difference in the
boundary line.

The keyboard handler sets WSYNC
repeatedly while generating the
keyboard click on the console
speaker at 53279 ($D01F).  When
interrupts are generated during the
WSYNC period, they get delayed by
one scan line. To bypass this,
examine the VCOUNT register below
and delay the interrupt processing
by one line when no WSYNC delay has
occurred.
