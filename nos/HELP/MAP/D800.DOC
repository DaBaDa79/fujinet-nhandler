OPERATING SYSTEM ROM

Locations 55296 to 65535 ($D800 to
$FFFF) are the OS ROM.  These
locations are contained in the 10K
ROM cartridge, which sits in the
front slot of the Atari 800 or
inside the Atari 400. The OS is
identical for both computers.

The locations given here are for the
"A" version of the OS ROMs.  There
are changes in the new "B" version
ROMs, which are explained in the
appendix. Most of the changes affect
the interrupt handler routines and
SIO. In making these changes, Atari
cured some bugs such as the device
time-out problem. Unfortunately,
there is a cloud with this silver
lining: not all of your old software
will run with the new ROMs.
Megalegs, one of my favorite games,
cannot run under the new ROMs. A
pity that. There are others; I'm
sure you'll find them. The solution
is to have both sets of ROMs so you
can use all of your software.

FLOATING POINT PACKAGE ROM

Locations 55296 to 57343 ($D800 to
$DFFF) are reserved for the ROM's
Floating Point Mathematics Package.
There are other areas used by the FP
package: page zero (locations 212 to
254; $D4 to $FE) and page five
(locations 1406 to 1535; $57E to
$5FF), which are used only if FP
routines are called. There are also
trigonometric functions in the BASIC
cartridge located between 48549 and
49145 ($BDA5 to $BFF9) which use the
FP routines. See De Re Atari for
more information.

These are the entry points to some
of the subroutines; unless otherwise
noted, they use FP register zero
(FR0 at 212 to 217, $D4 to $DB):
