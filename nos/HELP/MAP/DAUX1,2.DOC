Used for device specific information
such as the disk sector number for the
read or write operation. Loaded down
to locations 572, 573 ($23C, $23D) by
SIO.

There are only five commands supported
by the disk handler: GET sector (82;
$52), PUT sector (80; $50), PUT sector
with VERIFY (87; $57), STATUS request
(83; $53) and FORMAT entire disk (33;
$21). There is no command to FORMAT a
portion of the disk; this is done by
the INS 1771-1 formatter/controller
chip in the drive itself and isn't
user-accessible. There is a new disk
drive ROM to replace the current "C"
version. It is the "E" ROM. Not only
is it faster than the older ROMs, but
it also allows for selective
formatting of disk sectors. Atari has
not announced yet whether this new 810
ROM will be made available. For more
information, see the OS User's Manual.
