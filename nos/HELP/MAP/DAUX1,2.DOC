Used for device specific information
such as the disk sector number for
the read or write operation. Loaded
down to locations 572, 573 ($23C,
$23D) by SIO.

There are only five commands
supported by the disk handler: GET
sector (82; $52), PUT sector (80;
$50), PUT sector with VERIFY (87;
$57), STATUS request (83; $53) and
FORMAT entire disk (33; $21). There
is no command to FORMAT a portion of
the disk; this is done by the INS
1771-1 formatter/controller chip in
the drive itself and isn't
user-accessible. There is a new disk
drive ROM to replace the current "C"
version. It is the "E" ROM. Not only
is it faster than the older ROMs,
but it also allows for selective
formatting of disk sectors. Atari
has not announced yet whether this
new 810 ROM will be made available.
For more information, see the OS
User's Manual.

Locations 780 to 793 ($30C to $319)
are for miscellaneous use.
Locations 794 to 831 ($31A to $33F)
are handler address tables. To use
these DCBs, the user must provide
the required parameters to this
block and then do a machine language
JSR to $E453 (58451) for disk I/O or
$E459 (58457; the SIO entry point)
for other devices.
