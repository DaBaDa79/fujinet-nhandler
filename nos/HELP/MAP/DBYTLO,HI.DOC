The number of bytes transferred to or
from the data buffer (or the disk) as
a result of the most recent operation,
set by the handler.  Also used for the
count of bad sector data. There is a
small bug in SIO which causes
incorrect system actions when the last
byte in a buffer is in a memory
location ending with $FF, such as
$A0FF.
