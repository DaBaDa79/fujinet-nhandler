768          0300          DDEVIC

Device serial bus ID (serial device
type) set up by the handler,not
user-alterable. Values are:

Disk drives  D1-D4  49-52  ($31-$34)
Printer      P1        64      ($40)
Printer      P2        79      ($4F)
RS232 ports  R1-R4  80-83  ($50-$53)

Locations 768 to 831 ($300 to $33F)
are used for the device handler and
vectors to the handler routines
(devices S:, P:, E:, D:, C:, R: and
K:).  A device handler is a routine
used by the OS to control the transfer
of data in that particular device for
the task allotted (such as read,
write, save, etc.). The resident D:
handler does not conform entirely with
the other handler--SIO calling
routines. Instead, you use the DCB to
communicate directly with the disk
handler. The device handler for R: is
loaded in from the 850 interface
module. See De Re Atari, the 850
Interface Manual, and the OS Listings
pages 64 - 65.

Locations 768 to 779 ($300 to $30B)
are the resident Device Control Block
(DCB) addresses, used for I/O
operations that require the serial
bus; also used as the disk DCB.
DUP.SYS uses this block to interface
the FMS with the disk handler. The
Atari disk drive uses a serial access
at 19,200 baud (about 20 times slower
than the Apple!). It has its own
microprocessor, a 6507, plus 128 bytes
of RAM, a 2316 2K masked ROM chip
(like a 2716), a 2332 RAM-I/O timer
chip with another 128 bytes of RAM
(like the PIA chip) and a WD 1771 FD
controller chip.  See the "Outpost
Atari" column, Creative Computing, May
1982, for an example of using the disk
DCB.

All of the parameters passed to SIO
are contained in the DCB. SIO uses the
DCB information and returns the status
in the DCB for subsequent use by the
device handler.
