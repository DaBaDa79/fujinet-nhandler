ANTIC

54272-54783    D400-D5FF

ANTIC is a special, separate
microprocessor used in your Atari to
control C/GTIA, the screen display,
and other screen-related functions
including processing the NMI
interrupts. It uses its own
instruction set, called the display
list, which tells ANTIC where to
find the screen data in RAM and how
to display it. ANTIC also uses an
internal four bit counter called the
Delta Counter (DCTR) to control the
vertical dimension of each block.

(W) Direct Memory Access (DMA)
control. It is also used to define
one- or two-line resolution for
players and to turn on players and
missiles. Values are POKEd into the
shadow register, 559 ($22F), and are
also described there.

You POKE the shadow register with
the following numbers in order to:

Turn off the playfield              0
Use narrow playfield                1
Use normal playfield                2
Use wide playfield                  3
Enable missile DMA                  4
Enable player DMA                   8
Enable both player and missile DMA 12
Single line player resolution      16
Enable DMA Fetch instructions      32

Double line resolution is the
default status. Use this register in
conjunction with GRACTL at 53277
($D01D). Both must be set properly
or no display will result. BIT 5
enables DMA to fetch the display
list instructions. If BIT 5 is not
set (BIT 5 equals zero), ANTIC will
not work. DMACTL is initialized to
34 ($22).

A player in single line resolution
might look like this:

00011000                ##
00111100               ####
01111110              ######
11111111             ########
11111111             ########
01111110              ######
00111100               ####
00011000                ##

so that each byte is displayed on
one TV line. The same player in
double line resolution would look
like this:

00011000                ##
00011000                ##
00111100               ####
00111100               ####
01111110              ######
01111110              ######
11111111             ########
11111111             ########
11111111             ########
11111111             ########
01111110              ######
01111110              ######
00111100               ####
00111100               ####
00011000                ##
00011000                ##

where every byte is displayed over
two TV lines.
