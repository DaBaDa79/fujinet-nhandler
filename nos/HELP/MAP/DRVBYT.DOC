1802          070A          DRVBYT

The maximum number of disk drives in
your system, the DOS 2.0 default
value is two. The least four bits
are used to record which drives are
available, so if you have drives
one, three and four, this location
would read:

00001101 or 13 in decimal.

Each drive has a separate buffer of
128 bytes reserved for it in RAM. If
you have more or less than the
default (two), then POKE 1802 with
the appropriate number:

1 drive  =  1 BIT  0  Binary 00000001
2 drives =  3 BITS 0,1       00000011
3 drives =  7 BITS 0,1,2     00000111
4 drives = 15 BITS 0,1,2,3   00001111

This assumes you have them numbered
sequentially. If not, POKE the
appropriate decimal translation for
the correct binary code: each drive
is specified by one of the least
four bits from one in BIT 0 to four
in BIT 3. If you PEEK (1802) and get
back three, for example, it means
drives one and two are allocated,
not three drives.

You can save your modification to a
new disk by calling up DOS and
choosing menu selection "H." This
new DOS will then boot up with the
number of drives and buffers you
have allocated. A one-drive system
can save 128 bytes this way (256 if
one less data buffer is chosen). See
the DOS Manual, page G.87.
