Disk time-out register (the address of
the OS worst case disk time- out). It
is said by many sources to be set to
160 at initialization which represents
a 171 second time-out, but my system
shows a value of 224 on
initialization. Timer values are 64
seconds for each 60 units of
measurement expressed.

It is updated after each disk status
request to contain the value of the
third byte of the status frame
(location 748; $2EC). All disk
operations have a seven second
time-out (except FORMAT), established
by the disk handler (you had noticed
that irritating little delay, hadn't
you?). The "sleeping disk syndrome"
(the printer suffers from this malady
as well) happens when your drive times
out, or the timer value reaches zero.
This has been cured by the new OS "B"
version ROMs.
