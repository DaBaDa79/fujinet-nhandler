766          02FE          DSPFLG

Display flag, used in displaying the
control codes not associated with an
ESC character (see location 674;
$2A2). If zero is returned or POKEd
here, then the ATASCII codes 27 - 31,
123 - 127, 187 - 191 and 251 - 255
perform their normal display screen
control functions (i.e., clear screen,
cursor movement, delete/insert line,
etc.). If any other number is
returned, then a control character is
displayed (as in pressing the ESC key
with CTRL-CLEAR for a graphic
representation of a screen clear).
POKEing any positive number here will
force the display instead of the
control code action. There is,
however, a small bug, not associated
with location 766, in Atari BASIC: a
PRINTed CTRL-R or CTRL-U are both
treated as a semicolon.
