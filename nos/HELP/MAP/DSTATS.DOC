The status code upon return to user.
Also used to set the data direction;
whether the device is to send or
receive a data frame.  This byte is
used by the device handler to
indicate to SIO what to do after the
command frame is sent and
acknowledged. Prior to the SIO call,
the handler examines BIT 6 (one
equals receive data) and BIT 7 (one
equals send data). If both bits are
zero, then no data transfer is
associated with the operation. Both
bits set to one is invalid. SIO uses
it to indicate to the handler the
status of the requested operation
after the SIO call.
