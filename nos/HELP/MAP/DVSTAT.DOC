746-749       02EA-02ED     DVSTAT

Four device status registers used by
the I/O status operation as follows:

746 ($2EA) is the device error status
and the command status byte. If the
operation is a disk I/O, then the
status returned is that of the 1771
controller chip in your Atari disk
drive. Bits set to one return the
following error codes:

Bit Dec Error
0    1  An invalid command frame was
        received (error).
1    2  An invalid data frame was
        received.
2    4  An output operation was
        unsuccessful.
3    8  The disk is write-protected.
4   16  The system is inactive
        (on standby).
7   32  The peripheral controller is
        "intelligent" (has its own
        microprocessor: the disk
        drive). All Atari devices are
        intelligent except the
        cassette recorder, so BIT 7
        will normally be one when a
        device is attached.

747 ($2EB) is the device status byte.
For the disk, it holds the value of
the status register of the drive
controller. For the 850 Interface, it
holds the status for DSR,CTS,CRX and
RCV when concurrent I/O is not active
(see the 850 Interface Manual). It
also contains the AUX2 byte value from
the previous operation (see the IOCB
description at 832 to 959; $340 to
$3AF).

748 ($2EC) is the maximum device
time-out value in seconds. A value of
60 here represents 64 seconds. This
value is passed back to location 582
($246) after every disk status
request. Initialized to 31.

749 ($2ED) is used for number of bytes
in output buffer. See 850 Manual, p.
43.

When concurrent I/O is active, the
STATUS command returns the number of
characters in the input buffer to
locations 747 and 748, and the number
of characters in the output buffer to
location 749.
