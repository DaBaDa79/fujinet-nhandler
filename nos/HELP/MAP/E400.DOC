Screen Editor (E:) entry point table.

Locations 58368 to 58447 ($E400 to
$E44F) are the vector tables, stored
as LSB, MSB. These base addresses
are used by resident handlers.
Handler vectors use the following
format:

  OPEN vector
  CLOSE vector
  GET BYTE vector
  PUT BYTE vector
  GET STATUS vector
  SPECIAL vector
  Jump to handler initialization
  routine (JMP LSB/MSB)

The device tables in location 794
($31A) point to the particular
vector(s) used in each appropriate
table. In each case, the 6502 X
register is used to point to the
originating IOCB.
