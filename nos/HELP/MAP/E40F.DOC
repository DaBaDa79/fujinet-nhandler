If you PEEK here and get back 56,
then you have the older "A" version
of the OS ROMs. If you get back
zero, then you have the newer "B"
version that was released in January
1982. The "B" version fixes some
minor bugs, including the device
time-out problems, enables POKEY
timer four, and provides a vector
for BREAK key interrupts. See
Appendix 4.
