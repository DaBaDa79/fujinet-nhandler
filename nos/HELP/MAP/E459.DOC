Serial Input/Output (SIO) utility
entry point. SIO drives the serial
bus and the peripherals. When a
request is placed in the Device
Control Block (DCB) by a device
handler, SIO takes control and uses
the data in the DCB to perform the
operation required. SIO takes care
of the transfer of data as defined
by the DCB. CIO (above) is
responsible for the "packaging" of
the data and transfers control to
SIO when necessary. See the DCB
locations 768 to 779 ($300-$30B).

SIO first sends a command frame to
the device, consisting of five
bytes: the device ID, the command
BYTE, two auxiliary bytes for
device-specific information, then a
checksum (which is the sum of the
first four bytes). If the device
acknowledges this frame, it is
followed, if necessary, by the data
frame of a fixed number of bytes
depending on the device record size,
plus a checksum byte. Initialized to
59737 ($E959).
