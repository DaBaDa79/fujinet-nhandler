58460          E45C          SETVBV

Set system timers during the VBLANK
routine. Uses the 6502 X register
for the MSB of vector/times, Y for
the LSB and A for the number of the
vector to hack (change). SETVBV
insures that both bytes of the
vector addressed will be updated
while VBLANK is enabled. You can JSR
here when creating your own timer
routines. See COMPUTE!, November
1981, for an application.
