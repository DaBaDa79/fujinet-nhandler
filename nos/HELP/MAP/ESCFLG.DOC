Escape flag. Normally zero, it is
set to 128 ($80) if the ESC key is
pressed (on detection of the ESC
character; 27, $1B). It is reset to
zero following the output of the
next character. To display ATASCII
control codes without the use of an
ESC character, set location 766
($2FE) to a non-zero value.
