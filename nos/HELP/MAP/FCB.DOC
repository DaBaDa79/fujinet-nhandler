4993-5120      1381-1400      FCB

Start of the FMS File Control Blocks
(FCB's). FCB's are used to store
information about files currently
being processed. The eight FCB's are
16-byte blocks that correspond in a
one-on-one manner with the IOCB's.
Each FCB consist of:

Label  Bytes Purpose
FCBFNO   1   File number of the cur-
             rent file being proc'd.
FCBOTC   1   Which mode the file has
             been OPENed for: append
             is one, directory read
             is two, input is four,
             output is eight, update
             is twelve.
SPARE    1   Not used.
FCBSLT   1   Flag for the sector
             length type; 128 or 256
             bytes
FCBFLG   1   Working flag. If equal
             to 128 ($80), then the
             file has been OPENed for
             output or append and may
             acquire new data sec-
             tors. If the value is
             64, then sector is in
             the memory buffer await-
             ing writing to disk.
FCBMLN   1   Max sector data length;
             125 or 253 bytes depend-
             ing on drive type (sin-
             gle or double density).
             The last three sector
             bytes are reserved for
             sector link and byte
             count data.
FCBDLN   1   Current byte to be read
             or modified in the oper-
             ation in a data sector.
FCBBUF   1   Tell FMS which buffer
             has been allocated to
             the file being processed
FCBCSN   2   Sector number of the
             sector currently in the
             buffer.
FCBLSN   2   Number of the next
             sector in data chain.
FCBSSN   2   Starting sectors for
             appended data if the
             file has been OPENed for
             append.
FCBCNT   2   Sector count for the
             current file.

DUP doesn't use these FCB's; it writes
to the IOCB's directly.  CIO transfers
the control to FMS as the operation
demands, then on to SIO.
