Subroutines to test the acceptance
of the last key pressed and to
process the debounce delay routines
start here.  When a key is pressed,
it initiates an IRQ through VKEYBD
at locations 520, 521 ($208, $209)
to 65470 ($FFBE). This is the
keyboard service routine. It
processes debounce, and SHIFT- CTRL
logic (see location 559; $22F);
saves the internal keyboard code in
754 ($2F2) and 764 ($2FC); sets the
ATTRACT mode flag at 77 ($4D) and
sets location 555 ($22B -- SRTIMR)
to 48 ($30).
