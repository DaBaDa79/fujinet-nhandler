53277          D01D          GRACTL

(W) Used with DMACTL (location 54272;
$D400) to latch all stick and paddle
triggers (to remember if triggers on
joysticks or paddles have been
pressed), to turn on players and to
turn on missiles. To get the values to
be POKEd here, add the following
options together for the desired
function:

                        Decimal   Bit
To turn on missiles        1       0
To turn on players         2       1
To latch trigger inputs    4       2

To revoke P/M authorization and turn
off both players and missiles, POKE
53277,0. Once latched, triggers will
give a continuous "button pressed"
read the first time they are pressed
until BIT 2 is restored to zero.
Triggers are placed in "latched" mode
when each individual trigger is
pressed, but you cannot set the latch
mode for individual triggers.

Have you ever hit BREAK during a
program and still had players or their
residue left on the screen? Sometimes
hitting RESET doesn't clear this
material from the screen. There are
ways to get rid of it:

POKE 623,4:   This moves all players
              behind playfields.
POKE 53277,0: This should turn them
              off.
POKE 559,2:   This should return you
              to a blank screen.

Make sure you SAVE your program before
POKEing, just in case!
