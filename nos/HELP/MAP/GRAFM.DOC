53265          D011          GRAFM

(W) Graphics for all missiles, not
used with DMA. GRAFM works the same as
GRAFP0 above. Each pair of bits
represents one missile, with the same
allocation as in 53260 ($D00C) above.

Bit      7 6  5 4  3 2  1 0
Missile  -3-  -2-  -1-  -0-

Each bit set will create a vertical
line running the entire height of the
TV screen. Missile graphics shapes may
be set separately from each other by
using the appropriate bit pairs. To
mask out unwanted players, write zeros
to the bits as above.

              TRIG1

(R) Joystick trigger 1 (645).
Controller jack two, pin six.
