53261          D00D          GRAFP0

(W) Graphics shape for player 0
written directly to the player
graphics register. In using these
registers, you bypass ANTIC.  You
only use the GRAFP# registers when
you are not using Direct Memory
Access (DMA: see GRACTL at 53277).
If DMA is enabled, then the graphics
registers will be loaded
automatically from the area
specified by PMBASE (54279; $D407).

The GRAF registers can only write a
single byte to the playfield, but it
runs the entire height of the
screen. Try this to see:

10  POKE 53248, 160: REM SET HORIZONTAL POSITION OF PLAYER 0
20  POKE 704, 245: REM SET PLAYER 0 COLOUR TO ORANGE
30  POKE 53261, 203: REM BIT PATTERN 11001011

To remove it, POKE 53261 with zero.
The bit order runs from seven to
zero, left to right across the TV
screen. Each bit set will appear as
a vertical line on the screen. A
value of 255 means all bits are set,
creating a wide vertical line. You
can also use the size registers to
change the player width. Using the
GRAF registers will allow you to use
players and missiles for such things
as boundaries on game or text fields
quite easily.

(R) Player 1 to player collisions.
