(W) POKE with any number to clear all
player/missile collision registers. It
is important to clear this register
often in a program -- such as a game
-- which frequently tests for
collisions.  Otherwise, old collision
values may remain and confuse the
program. A good way to do this is to
POKE HITCLR just before an event which
may lead to a collision; for example,
right before a joystick or paddle is
"read" to move a player or fire a
missile.  Then test for a collision
immediately after the action has taken
place. Remember that multiple
collisions cause sums of the collision
values to be written to the collision
registers; if you do not clear HITCLR
often enough, a program checking for
individual collisions will be thrown
off by these sums.
