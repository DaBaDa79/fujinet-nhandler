(W) Horizontal position of missile
0. Missiles move horizontally like
players. See the note in 53248
($D000) concerning the use of
horizontal registers.

(R) Player 0 to playfield
collisions. There are some problems
using collision detection in
graphics modes nine to eleven. There
are no obviously recognized
collisions in GR.9 and GR.11. In
GR.10 collisions work only for the
playfield colors that correspond to
the usual playfield registers. Also,
the background (BAK) color is set by
PCOLR0 (location 704; $2C0) rather
than the usual COLOR4 (location 712;
$2C8), which will affect the
priority detection. In GR.10,
playfield colors set by PCOLR0 to
PCOLR3 (704 to 707; $2C0 to $2C3)
behave like players where priority
is concerned. Bit use is:

      Bit    7  6  5   4  3  2  1  0
Playfield    ...unused..  3  2  1  0
  Decimal    ...........  8  4  2  1
