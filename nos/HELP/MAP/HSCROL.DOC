(W) Horizontal scroll enable, POKE
HSCROL with from zero to 16 clock
cycles for the number of cycles to
scroll. Horizontal fine scrolls can
be used only if BIT 4 of the display
list instruction is set. The
difficulty in horizontal scrolling
lies in arranging the screen data to
be scrolled in such a manner as to
prevent wraparound (i.e., the bit or
byte scrolled off screen in one line
becomes the bit or byte scrolled on
screen in an adjacent line).  Normal
data arranged for TV display looks
like this on the screen:

+----------+
|..........|
|..........|
|..........|
|..........|
|..........|
|..........|
+----------+

where it is a one-dimensional memory
area "folded" at the proper places
to create the image of a two
dimensional screen. This is done by
the DL character or map mode
instruction. Without other
instructions, it reads the memory
continuously from the first
specified location, each line taking
the correct number of bytes for the
GRAPHICS mode specified. To properly
scroll it horizontally, you must
arrange it in relation to the TV
screen like this:

     +----------+
.....|..........|.....
.....|..........|.....
.....|..........|.....
.....|..........|.....
.....|..........|.....
.....|..........|.....
     +----------+

Now you will have to make each
display instruction for each line
into a Load Memory Scan (LMS)
instruction. To direct each LMS to
the proper screen RAM for that line,
you will have to increment each
memory location by the total length
of the line. For example, if you
want to scroll a 256-byte horizontal
screen, each LMS instruction will
have to point to a location in
memory 256 bytes above the last one.
Of course, you will have to
implement error-trapping routines so
that your screen does not extend
beyond your desired boundaries.

Coarse scrolling, one byte at a
time, can be done without setting
the HSCROL register by the method
described above. For smooth
scrolling, you will have to use this
register. See De Re Atari.
