Addresses for the interrupt handler
routines:

59123 ($E6F3) PIRQ;

IRQ interrupt service routines start
here.

59126 ($E6F6);

the immediate IRQ vector to the IRQ
handler. The global NMI and IRQ RAM
vectors in locations 512 to 527
($200 to $20F) are all initialized
to this area (59142, $E706 for the
new OS ROMs).

59314 ($E7B2);

the vector for the IRQ interrupts on
powerup; it points to a PLA and RTI
instruction sequence (new OS ROMs;
59219; $E78F).

59316 ($E7B4) PNMI;

the NMI handler, tests for the
reason for the NMI, then jumps
through the appropriate RAM vector.
Also called the Interrupt Service
Routine (ISR).

59345 ($E7D1) SYSVBL;

the VBLANK routines start here,
including frame counter, update
timer, update hardware registers
from shadow registers, update the
attract mode counter and the
realtime clock. The vertical blank
immediate vector, VVBLKL1, normally
pointed to by locations 546, 547
($222, $223), points to here.  The
Updated OS ROMs point to 59310
($E7AE).

59666 ($E912) SETVBL;

subroutines to set the VBLANK timers
and vectors.

The vertical blank deferred
interrupt, normally vectored from
locations 548, 549 ($224, $225),
points to 59710 ($E93E). In the
Updated OS ROMs, it points to 59653
($E905). In both cases they point to
the VBLANK exit routine.

See page 104 of the OS User's Manual
for a list of the vectors and MICRO,
January 1982, for an explanation of
the VBLANK process.
