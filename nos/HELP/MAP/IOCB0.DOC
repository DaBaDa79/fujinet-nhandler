832-847       0340-034F       IOCB0

I/O Control Block (IOCB) zero.
Normally used for the screen editor
(E:). You can POKE 838,166 and POKE
839,238 and send everything to the
printer instead of to the screen (POKE
838,163, and POKE 839,246 to send
everything back to the screen again).
You could use this in a program to
toggle back and forth between screen
and printed copy when prompted by user
input. This will save you multiple
PRINT and LPRINT coding.

You can use these locations to
transfer data to other devices as well
since they point to the address of the
device's "put one byte" routine. See
the OS Manual for more information.
Location 842 can be given the value 13
for read from screen and 12 for write
to screen. POKE 842,13 puts the Atari
into "RETURN key mode" by setting the
auxiliary byte one (ICAX1) to screen
input and output. POKEing 842 with 12
returns it to keyboard input and
screen output mode. The former mode
allows for dynamic use of the screen
to act upon commands the cursor is
made to move across.

You can use this "forced read" mode to
read data on the screen into BASIC
without user intervention. For
example, in the program below, lines
100 through 200 will be deleted by the
program itself as it runs.

10 GRAPHICS 0:POSITlON 2,4
20 PRINT 100:PRINT 150:PRINT 200
25 PRINT "CONT"
30 POSITION 2,0
50 POKE 842,13:STOP
60 POKE 842,12
70 REM THE NEXT LINES WILL BE DELETED
100 PRINT "DELETING..."
150 PRINT "DELETING..."
200 PRINT "DELETED!"

See COMPUTE!, August 1981, for a
sample of this powerful technique. See
Santa Cruz's Tricky Tutorial #1
(display lists) for another
application. The last four bytes (844
to 847; $34C to $34F in this case) are
spare (auxiliary) bytes in all IOCB's.
 When you are in a GRAPHICS mode other
than zero, channel zero is OPENed for
the text window area. If the window is
absent and you OPEN channel zero, the
whole screen returns to mode zero. A
BASIC NEW or RUN command closes all
channels except zero. OPENing a
channel to S: or E: always clears the
display screen.

See COMPUTE!, October 1981,for an
example of using an IOCB with the
cassette program recorder, and
September 1981 for another use with
the Atari 825 printer.
