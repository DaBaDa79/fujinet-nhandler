IOCB six. The GRAPHICS statement OPENs
channel six for screen display (S:),
so once you are out of mode zero, you
cannot use channel six unless you
first issue a CLOSE#6 statement. If
you CLOSE this channel, you will not
be able to use the DRAWTO, PLOT or
LOCATE commands until you reOPEN the
channel. The LOAD command closes
channel six; it also closes all
channels except zero.
