(W) Start the POKEY timers (the AUDF
registers above). You POKE any
non-zero value here to load and
start the timers; the value isn't
itself used in the calculations.
This resets all of the audio
frequency dividers to their AUDF
values. If enabled by IRQEN below,
these AUDF registers generate timer
interrupts when they count down from
the number you POKEd there to zero.
The vectors for the AUDF1, AUDF2 and
AUDF4 timer interrupts are located
between 528 and 533 ($210 and $215).
POKEY timer four interrupt is only
enabled in the new "B" OS ROMs.

              KBCODE

(R) Holds the keyboard code which is
then loaded into the shadow register
(764; $2FC) when a key is hit.
Usually read in response to the
keyboard interrupt. Compares the
value with that in CH1 at 754
($2F2). If both values are the same,
then the new code is accepted only
if a suitable key debounce delay
time has passed.  The routines which
test to see if the key code will be
accepted start at 65470 ($FFBE). BIT
7 is the control key flag, BIT 6 is
the shift key flag.
