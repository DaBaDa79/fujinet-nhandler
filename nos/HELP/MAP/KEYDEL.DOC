753          02F1          KEYDEL

Key delay flag or key debounce
counter; used to see if any key has
been pressed. If a zero is returned,
then no key has been pressed. If
three is returned, then any key. It
is decremented every stage two
VBLANK (1/60 or 1/30th second) until
it reaches zero. If any key is
pressed while KEYDEL is greater than
zero, it is ignored as "bounce." See
COMPUTE!, December 1981, for a
routine to change the keyboard delay
to suit your own typing needs.
