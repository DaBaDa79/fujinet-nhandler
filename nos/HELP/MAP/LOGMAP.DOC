690-693    02B2-02B5       LOGMAP

Logical line start bit map. These
locations map the beginning physical
line number for each logical line on
the screen (initially 24, for GR.0).
Each bit in the first three bytes
shows the start of a logical line if
the bit equals one (three bytes
equals eight bits * three equals 24
lines on the screen). The map format
is as follows:

                Bit
 7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0   Byte
-------------------------------------
Line
 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7    690
 8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15    691
16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23    692
--  --  --  --  --  --  --  --    693

The last byte is ignored. The map
bits are all set to one when the
text screen is OPENed or CLEARed,
when a GRAPHICS com- mand is issued
or RESET is pressed. The map is
updated as logical lines are
entered, edited, or deleted.
