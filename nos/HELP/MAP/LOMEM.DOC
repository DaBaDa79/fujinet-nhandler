128          0080          LOMEM

Pointer to BASIC's low memory (at the
high end of OS RAM space). The first
256 bytes of the memory pointed to are
the token output buffer, which is used
by BASIC to convert BASIC statements
into numeric representation (tokens;
see locations 136, 137; $88, $89).
This value is loaded from MEMLO
(locations 743, 744; $2E7, $2E8) on
initialization or the execution of a
NEW command (not on RESET!). Remember
to update this value when changing
MEMLO to reserve space for drivers or
buffers.  When a BASIC SAVE is made,
two blocks of information are written:
the first block is the seven pointers
from LOMEM to STARP (128 to 141; $80
to $8D). The value of LOMEM is
subtracted from each of these two-byte
pointers in the process, so the first
two bytes written will both be zero.
The second block contains the
following: the variable name table,
the variable value table, the
tokenized program, and the immediate
mode line.

When a BASIC LOAD is made, BASIC adds
the value at MEMLO (743, 744; $2E7,
$2E8) to each of the two-byte pointers
SAVEd as above. The pointers are
placed back in page zero, and the
values of RUNSTK (142, 143; $8E, $8F)
and MEMTOP (144, 145; $90, $91) are
set to the value in STARP. Then 256
bytes are reserved above the value in
MEMLO for the token output buffer, and
the program is read in immediately
following this buffer.  When you don't
have DOS or any other application
program using low memory loaded, LOMEM
points to 1792 ($700). When DOS 2.0 is
present, it points to 7420 ($1CFC).
When you change your drive and data
buffer defaults (see 1801, 1802; $709,
$70A), you will raise or lower this
figure by 128 bytes for each buffer
added or deleted, respectively. When
you boot up the RS-232 handler, add
another 1728 ($6C0) bytes used.  LOMEM
is also called ARGOPS by BASIC when
used in expression evaluation. When
BASIC encounters any kind of
expression, it puts the immediate
results into a stack. ARGOPS points to
the same 256 byte area; for this
operation it is reserved for both the
argument and operator stack. It is
also called OUTBUFF for another
operation, pointing to the same 256
byte buffer as ARGOPS points to. Used
by BASIC when checking a line for
syntax and converting it to tokens.
This buffer temporarily stores the
tokens before moving them to the
program.
