565          0235          LPENV

Light pen vertical value: shadow for
54285 ($D40D). Value is the same as
VCOUNT register for two-line
resolution (see 54283; $D40B). Both
light pen values are modified when the
trigger is pressed (pulled low). The
light pen positions are not the same
as the normal screen row and column
positions. There are 96 vertical
positions, numbered from 16 at the top
to 111 at the bottom, each one
equivalent to a scan line. Horizontal
positions are marked in color clocks.
There are 228 horizontal positions,
numbered from 67 at the left. When the
LPENH value reaches 255, it is reset
to zero and begins counting again by
one to the rightmost edge, which has a
value of seven.

Obviously, because of the number of
positions readable and the small size
of each, a certain leeway must be
given by the programmer when using
light pen readouts on a program. At
the time of this writing, Atari had
not yet released its light pen onto
the market, although other companies
have.
