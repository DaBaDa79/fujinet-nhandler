(W) Non-maskable interrupt (NMI)
enable. POKE with 192 to enable the
Display List Interrupts. When BIT 7 is
set to one, it means DL instruction
interrupt; any display list
instruction where BIT 7 equals one
will cause this interrupt to be
enabled at the start of the last video
line displayed by that instruction.
When BIT 6 equals one, it allows the
Vertical Blank Interrupt and when BIT
5 equals one, it allows the RESET
button interrupt. The RESET interrupt
is never disabled by the OS. You
should never press RESET during
powerup since it will be acted upon.

NMIEN is set to 64 ($40) by the OS IRQ
code on powerup, enabling VBI's, but
disabling DLI's. All NMI interrupts
are vectored through 65530 ($FFFA) to
the NMI service routine at 59316
($E7B4) to determine their cause.
