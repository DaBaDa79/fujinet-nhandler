(W) Reset for NMIST (below); clears
the interrupt request register;
resets all of the NMI status
together.

              NMIST

(R) NMI status; holds cause for the
NMI interrupt in BITs 5, 6 and 7;
corresponding to the same bits in
NMIEN above. If a DLI is pending, a
jump is made through the global RAM
vector VDSLST (512; $200). The OS
doesn't use DLI's, so 512 is
initialized to point to an RTI
instruction and must be changed by
the user before a DLI is allowed.

If the interrupt is not a DLI, then
a test is made to see if the
interrupt was caused by pressing
RESET key and, if so, a jump is made
to 58484 ($E474). If not a RESET
interrupt, then the system assumes
the interrupt was a VBLANK
interrupt, and a jump is made
through VVBLKI at 546 ($222), which
normally points to the stage one
VBLANK processor. From there it
checks the flag at CRITIC (66; $42)
and, if not from a critical section,
jumps through VVBLKD at 548 ($224),
which normally points to the VBLANK
exit routine. On powerup, the VBLANK
interrupts are enabled while the
display list interrupts are
disabled. See the end of the memory
map for a description of the VBLANK
procedures.  For IRQ interrupts, see
location 53744 ($D20E).
