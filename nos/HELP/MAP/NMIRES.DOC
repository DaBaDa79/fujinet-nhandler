54287          D40F          NMIRES

(W) Reset for NMIST (below); clears
the interrupt request register; resets
all of the NMI status together.

              NMIST

(R) NMI status; holds cause for the
NMI interrupt in BITs 5, 6 and 7;
corresponding to the same bits in
NMIEN above. If a DLI is pending, a
jump is made through the global RAM
vector VDSLST (512; $200). The OS
doesn't use DLI's, so 512 is
initialized to point to an RTI
instruction and must be changed by the
user before a DLI is allowed.

If the interrupt is not a DLI, then a
test is made to see if the interrupt
was caused by pressing RESET key and,
if so, a jump is made to 58484
($E474). If not a RESET interrupt,
then the system assumes the interrupt
was a VBLANK interrupt, and a jump is
made through VVBLKI at 546 ($222),
which normally points to the stage one
VBLANK processor. From there it checks
the flag at CRITIC (66; $42) and, if
not from a critical section, jumps
through VVBLKD at 548 ($224), which
normally points to the VBLANK exit
routine. On powerup, the VBLANK
interrupts are enabled while the
display list interrupts are disabled.
See the end of the memory map for a
description of the VBLANK procedures.
For IRQ interrupts, see location 53744
($D20E).

---------------------------------------
Locations 54288 to 54303 ($D410 to
$D41F) are repeats of locations 54272
to 54287 ($D400 to $D40F).

---------------------------------------
Locations 54784 to 55295 ($D600 to
$D7FF) are unused but not empty nor
user alterable. See the note at 53504
($D100).

OPERATING SYSTEM ROM

Locations 55296 to 65535 ($D800 to
$FFFF) are the OS ROM.  These
locations are contained in the 10K ROM
cartridge, which sits in the front
slot of the Atari 800 or inside the
Atari 400. The OS is identical for
both computers.

The locations given here are for the
"A" version of the OS ROMs.  There are
changes in the new "B" version ROMs,
which are explained in the appendix.
Most of the changes affect the
interrupt handler routines and SIO. In
making these changes, Atari cured some
bugs such as the device time-out
problem. Unfortunately, there is a
cloud with this silver lining: not all
of your old software will run with the
new ROMs. Megalegs, one of my favorite
games, cannot run under the new ROMs.
A pity that. There are others; I'm
sure you'll find them. The solution is
to have both sets of ROMs so you can
use all of your software.

FLOATING POINT PACKAGE ROM

Locations 55296 to 57343 ($D800 to
$DFFF) are reserved for the ROM's
Floating Point Mathematics Package.
There are other areas used by the FP
package: page zero (locations 212 to
254; $D4 to $FE) and page five
(locations 1406 to 1535; $57E to
$5FF), which are used only if FP
routines are called. There are also
trigonometric functions in the BASIC
cartridge located between 48549 and
49145 ($BDA5 to $BFF9) which use the
FP routines. See De Re Atari for more
information.

These are the entry points to some of
the subroutines; unless otherwise
noted, they use FP register zero (FR0
at 212 to 217, $D4 to $DB):
