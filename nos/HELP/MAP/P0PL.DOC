53260          D00C          SIZEM

(W) Size for all missiles; set bits
as below (decimal values included):

Bits               Size:
                   Normal Double Quad
7 & 6: missile 3   0,128   64     192
5 & 4: missile 2   0, 32   16      48
3 & 2: missile 1   0,  8    4      12
1 & 0: missile 0   0,  2    1       3

where turning on the bits in each
each pair above does as follows:

0 and 0: normal size -- two color
         clocks wide
0 and 1: twice normal size -- four
         color clocks wide
1 and 0: normal size
1 and 1: four times normal size --
         eight color clocks wide

So, to get a double-sized missile 2,
you would set BITs 5 and 6, or POKE
53260,48. Each missile can have a
size set separately from the other
missiles or players when using the
GRAF registers.  A number of
sources, including De Re Atari, say
that you can set neither missile
sizes nor shapes separately. Here's
a routine to show that you can in
fact do both:

10  POKE 53265,255: REM SHAPE START
15  GR.7
20  POKE 623,1: REM SET PRIORITIES
30  FOR X = 1 TO 25
35  F = 50
40  FOR C = 704 TO 707: POKE C,F + X:F = F + 50: NEXT C: REM COLOURS
45  S = 100
50  FOR P = 53252 TO 53255: POKE P,S + X: S = S + 20: NEXT P : REM SCREEN POSITIONS
60  NEXT X
70  INPUT A,B: REM MISSILE SIZE AND SHAPES
80  POKE 53260,A: POKE 53265,5
100 GOTO 30

Here's another example using DMA;
GRACTL and DACTL (53277 and 54272;
$D0lD and $D400):

10  POKE 623,1: POKE 559,54: POKE 54279, 224: POKE 53277,1
20  FOR N = 53252 TO 53255: POKE N, 100 + X: X = X + 10: NEXT N: X = 0
30  INPUT SIZE: POKE 53260, SIZE
40  GOTO 30

information on P/M graphics.

              P0PL

(R) Player 0 to player collisions.
Bit use is:

Bit     7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
Player  ...unused....   3   2   1   0
Decimal .............   8   4   2   1
