624          0270          PADDL0

Locations 624 to 647 ($270 to $287)
are used for game controllers: paddle,
joystick and lightpen values.

The value of paddle 0 (paddles are
also called pots, short for
potentiometer); PEEK 624 returns a
number between zero and 228 ($E4),
increasing as the knob is turned
counter-clockwise.  When used to move
a player or cursor (i.e., PLOT
PADDLE(0),0), test your screen first.
Many sets will not display locations
less than 48 ($30) or greater than 208
($D0), and in many GRAPHICS modes you
will get an ERROR 141 -- cursor out of
range. Paddles are paired in the
controller jacks, so paddle 0 and
paddle 1 both use jack one. PADDL
registers are shadows for POKEY
locations 53760 to 53767 ($D200 to
$D207).
