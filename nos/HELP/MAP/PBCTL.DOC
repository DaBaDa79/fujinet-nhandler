54019          D303          PBCTL

(W/R) Port B controller. Initialized
to 60 ($3C) by the OS IRQ code. PBCTL
is the same as PACTL, above, with the
following exception (this may actually
perform the same function as in PACTL,
but I am not sure of the distinction
between descriptions):

Bit             Function
3               Peripheral command
identification (serial bus command),
initialized to 60 ($3C).

Ports can be used for external control
applications by the technically minded
reader who is willing to do some
soldering to develop cables and
connectors. A good example can be
found in COMPUTE!, February 1981,
where the author gives directions for
using jacks three and four as a
printer port. The Macrotronic printer
cables use just this method, bypassing
the 830 interface entirely (one way of
reducing your hardware costs).
Theoretically, the entire Atari can be
controlled through the ports!
