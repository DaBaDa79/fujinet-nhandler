704          02C0          PCOLR0

Color of player 0 and missile 0.
Locations 704 to 707 are also called
COLPM# in some sources. This is the
shadow for 53266 ($D012). In GTIA mode
ten, 704 holds the background color
(BAK; normally held by 712). You
cannot use the SETCOLOR commands to
change the PCOLR registers; color
values must be POKEd into them.

---------------------------------------
Locations 704 to 712 ($2C0 to $2C8)
are the color registers for players,
missiles, and playfields. These are
the RAM shadow registers for locations
53266 to 53274 ($D012 to $D01A). For
the latter, you can use the SETCOLOR
command from BASIC. For all registers
you can POKE the desired color into
the location by using this formula:

COLOR = HUE * 16 + LUMINANCE

It is possible to get more colors in
GR.8 than the one (and a half) that
Atari says is possible by using a
technique called artifacting. There is
a small example of artifacting shown
at location 710 ($2C6). See De Re
Atari, Your Atari 400/800, Creative
Computing, June 1981, and COMPUTE!,
May 1982.

Here are the 16 colors the Atari
produces, along with their POKE values
for the color registers. The POKE
values assume a luminance of zero. Add
the luminance value to the numbers to
brighten the color.  The color
registers ignore BIT 0; that's why
there are no "odd" values for
luminance, just even values.

COLOR             VALUE
Black           0,      0
Rust            1,     16
Red-orange      2,     32
Dark orange     3,     48
Red             4,     64
Dk lavender     5,     80
Cobalt blue     6,     96
Ultramarine     7,    112
Medium blue     8,    128
Dark blue       9,    144
Blue-grey      10,    160
Olive green    11,    176
Medium green   12,    192
Dark green     13,    208
Orange-green   14,    224
Orange         15,    240

The bit use of the PCOLR and COLOR
registers is as follows:

Bit     7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
        --color--   luminance unused
Grey    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  Darkest
Rust    0  0  0  1  0  0  1
           etc. to:      etc. to:
Orange  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  Lightest

When you enable the color overlap at
location 623 ($26F), ANTIC performs a
logical OR on the overlap areas. For
example:

         01000010 Red, luminance two
      OR 10011010 Dark blue, lum ten
         --------
Result = 10011010 Dark green, lum ten

Here's a short machine language
routine which will rotate the colors
in registers 705 to 712:

10   DIM ROT$(30)
20   FOR LOOP = 1 TO 27: READ BYTE: ROT$(LOOP,LOOP) = CHR$(BYTE): NEXT LOOP
.
.    PUT YOUR GRAPHICS ROUTINE HERE
.
100  CHANGE = USR(ADR(ROT$))
105  FOR LOOP = 1 TO 200: NEXT LOOP:GOTO 100
110  DATA 104,162,0,172,193,2,189,194,2,157
120  DATA 193,2,232,224,8,144,245,140,200,2
130  DATA  96,65,65,65,65,65,65

If you wish to rotate the colors in
registers 704 to 711 instead, change
lines 110 and 120 to read as follows:

110  DATA 104,162,0,172,192,2,189,193,2,157
120  DATA 192,2,232,224,8,144,245,140,199,2

If you wish to include all of the
registers 704 to 712 in the routine,
make the changes as above and change
the eight in line 120 to nine and
restore the 199 to 200 in line 120.
This routine works well with the GTIA
demos at location 623 ($26F).

Atari BASIC Reference Manual, pp.
45-56, and the GTIA Demo Disk from APX.
