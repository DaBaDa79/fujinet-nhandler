The Peripheral Interface Adapter (PIA)
integrated circuit is a special          
microprocessor used to control the       
Atari ports, controller jacks one to  
four. Ports can be used for both input
and output simultaneously or          
alternately. Barely tapped at the time
of this writing, the ports represent a
major resource for external (and         
internal) control and expansion. PIA  
also processes two of the IRQ         
interrupts: VINTER and VPRCED,        
vectored at locations 514 to 517 ($202
to $205). These interrupts are unused 
by the OS, but also may be used to       
provide greater control over external 
devices.
