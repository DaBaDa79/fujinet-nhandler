POKEY

53760-54015    D200-D2FF

POKEY is a digital I/O chip that
controls the audio frequency and
control registers, frequency dividers,
poly noise counters, pot (paddle)
controllers, the random number
generator, keyboard scan, serial port
I/O, and the IRQ interrupts.

The AUDF# (audio frequency) locations
are used for the pitch for the
corresponding sound channels, while
the AUDC# (audio control registers)
are the volume and distortion values
for those same channels. To POKE sound
values, you must first POKE zero into
locations 53768 ($D208) and a three
into 53775 ($D20F).

Frequency values can range from zero
to 255 ($FF), although the value is
increased by the computer by one to
range from one to 256. Note that the
sum of the volumes should not exceed
32, since volume is controlled by the
least four bits. It is set from zero
as no volume to 15 ($F) as the
highest. A POKE with 16 ($10) forces
sound output even if volume is not set
(i.e., it pushes the speaker cone out.
A tiny "pop" will be heard). The upper
four bits control distortion: 192
($C0) is for pure tone; other values
range from 32 to 192. Note that in
BASIC, the BREAK key will not turn off
the sound; RESET will, however. See De
Re Atari and BYTE, April 1982, for
more information on sound generation.

The AUDF registers are also used as
the POKEY hardware timers.  These are
generally used when counting an
interval less than one VBLANK. For
longer intervals, use the software
timers in locations 536 to 545 ($218
to $221). You load the AUDCTL register
with the number for the desired clock
frequency. You then set the volume to
zero in the AUDC register associated
with the AUDF register you plan to use
as a timer. You load the AUDF register
itself with the number of clock
intervals you wish to count. Then you
load your interrupt routine into
memory, and POKE the address into the
appropriate timer vector between
locations 528 and 533 ($210 and $215).
You must set the proper bit(s) in
IRQEN and its shadow register POKMSK
at location 16 ($10) to enable the
interrupt.  Finally, you load STIMER
with any value to load and start the
timer(s). The OS will force a jump to
the timer vector and then to your
routine when the AUDF register counts
down to zero. Timer processing can be
preempted by ANTIC's DMA, a DLI, or
the VBLANK process.

POT values are for the paddles,
ranging from zero to 240, increasing
as the paddle knob is turned
counterclockwise, but values less than
40 and greater than 200 represent an
area on either edge of the screen that
may not be visible on all TV sets or
monitors.
