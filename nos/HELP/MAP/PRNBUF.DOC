Printer buffer. The printer handler
collects output from LPRINT
statements here, sending them to the
printer when an End of Line (EOL;
carriage return) occurs or when the
buffer is full. Normally this is 40
characters. However, if an LPRINT
statement generates fewer than 40
characters and ends with a semicolon
or 38 characters and ends with a
comma, Atari sends the entire buffer
on each FOR-NEXT loop, the extra
bytes filled with zeros. The output
of the next LPRINT statement will
appear in column 41 of the same
line. According to the Operating
System User's Manual, the Atari
supports an 80-column printer device
called P2:. Using OPEN and PUT
statements to P2: may solve this
problem. Here is a small routine for
a GR.0 BASIC screen dump:

10  DIM TEXT$(1000): OPEN#2,4,0,"S:":TRAP 1050
.
.
.
1000  FOR LINE = 1 TO 24: POSITION PEEK(82),LINE
1010  FOR COL = 1 TO 38: GET#2,CHAR:TEXT$(COL,COL)=CHR$(CHAR)
1020  NEXT COL: GET#2,COL
1030  LPRINT TEXT$
1040  NEXT LINE
1050  RETURN

You can use the PTABW register at
location 201 ($C9) to set the number
of spaces between print elements
separated by a comma.  The minimum
number of spaces accepted is two.
LPRINT automatically uses channel
seven for output. No OPEN statement
is necessary and CLOSE is automatic.

-----------------------------
Locations 1000 to 1020 ($3E8 to
$3FC) are a reserved spare buffer
area.
