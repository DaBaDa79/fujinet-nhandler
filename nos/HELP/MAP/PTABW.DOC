201          00C9          PTABW

This location specifies the number of
columns between TAB stops. The first
tab will beat PEEK(201). The default
is ten. This is the value between
items separated in a PRINT statement
by com- mas -- such as PRINT AS, LOOP,
C(12) -- not by the TAB key spacing.

The minimum number of spaces between
TABS is three. If you POKE 201,2, it
will be treated as four spaces, and
POKE 201,1 is treated as three spaces.
POKE 201,0 will cause the system to
hang when it encounters a PRINT
statement with commas. To change the
TAB key settings, see TABMAP
(locations 675 to 689; $2A3 - $2B1).
PTABW is not reset to the default
value by pressing RESET or changing
GRAPHICS modes (unlike TABMAP).  PTABW
works in all GRAPHICS modes, not
merely in text modes. The size of the
spaces between items depends on the
pixel size in the GRAPHICS mode in
use. For example, in GR.0, each space
is one character wide, while in GR.8
each space is one-half color clock
(one dot) wide.
