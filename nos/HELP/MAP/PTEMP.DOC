Temporary register used by the printer
handler for the value of the character
being output to the printer.

Locations 32 to 47 ($20 to $2F) are
the ZIOCB: Page zero Input-Output
Control Block. They use the same
structure as the IOCB's at locations
832 to 959 ($340 to $3BF). The ZIOCB
is used to communicate I/O con- trol
data between CIO and the device
handlers. When a CIO opera- tion is
initiated, the information stored in
the IOCB channel is moved here for use
by the CIO routines. When the
operation is finished, the updated
information is returned to the user
area.
