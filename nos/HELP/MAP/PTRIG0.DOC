636          027C          PTRIG0

Paddle trigger 0. Used to determine
if the trigger or hutton on paddle 0
is pressed (zero is returned) or not
(one is returned).  Since these are
the same lines as the joystick
left/right switches, you can use
PTRIG for horizontal movement.
PTRIG(1) - PTRIG(0) returns -1
(left), 0 (center), + 1 (right). The
next seven locations are for the
other paddle buttons. PTRIG 0 - 3
are shadows for PIA register 54016
($D300).
