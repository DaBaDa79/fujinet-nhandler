740          02E4          RAMSIZ

RAM size, high byte only; this is
the number of pages that the top of
RAM represents (one page equals 256
bytes). Since there can never be
less than a whole page, it becomes
practical to measure RAM in those
page units. This is the same value
as in RAMTOP, location 106 ($6A),
passed here from TRAMSZ, location 6.
Space saved by moving RAMSIZ or
RAMTOP has the advantage of being
above the display area. Initialized
to 160 for a 48K Atari.
