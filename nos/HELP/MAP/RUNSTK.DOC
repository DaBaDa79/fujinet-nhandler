142          008E          RUNSTK

Address of the runtime stack which
holds the GOSUB entries	(four bytes
each) and the FOR-NEXT entries (16
bytes each). The POP command in
BASIC affects this stack, pulling
entries off it one at a time for
each POP executed. The stack expands
and contracts as necessary while the
program is running.

Each GOSUB entry consists of four
bytes in this order: a zero to
indicate a GOSUB, a two-byte integer
line number on which the call
occurred, and an offset into that
line so the RETURN can come back and
execute the next statement.

Each FOR-NEXT entry contains 16
bytes in this order: first, the
limit the counter variable can
reach; second, the step or counter
increment. These two are allocated
six bytes each in BCD format (12
bytes total). The 13th byte is the
counter variable number with the MSB
set; the 14th and 15th are the line
number and the 16th is the line
offset to the FOR statement.  RUNSTK
is also called ENDSTAR; it is used
by BASIC to point to the end of the
string/array space pointed to by
STARR above.
