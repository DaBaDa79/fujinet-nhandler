559          022F          SDMCTL

Direct Memory Access (DMA) enable.
POKEing with zero allows you to turn
off ANTIC and speed up processing by
30%. Of course, it also means the
screen goes blank when ANTIC is turned
off! This is useful to speed things up
when you are doing a calculation that
would take a long time. It is also
handy to turn off the screen when
loading a drawing, then turning it on
when the screen is loaded so that it
appears instantly, complete on the
screen. To use it you must first
PEEK(559) and save the result in order
to return your screen to you. Then
POKE 559,0 to turn off ANTIC. When you
are ready to bring the screen back to
life, POKE 559 with the number saved
earlier.

This location is the shadow register
for 54272 ($D400), and the number you
PEEKed above defines the playfield
size, whether or not the missiles and
players are enabled, and the player
size resolution. To enable your
options by using POKE 559, simply add
up the values below to obtain the
correct number to POKE into SDMCTL.
Note that you must choose only one of
the four playfield options appearing
at the beginning of the list:

Option                 Decimal   Bit
No playfield                 0   0
Narrow playfield             1   0
Standard playfield           2   0,1
Wide playfield               3   0,1
Enable missle DMA            4   2
Enable player DMA            8   3
Enable player and
 missile DMA                12   2,3
One line player resolution  16   4
Enable instructions to
 fetch DMA (see below)      32   5

Note that two-line player resolution
is the default and that it is not
necessary to add a value to 559 to
obtain it. I have included the
appropriate bits affected in the table
above. The default is 34 ($22).

The playfield is the area of the TV
screen you will use for display, text,
and graphics. Narrow playfield is 128
color clocks (32 characters wide in
GR.0), standard playfield is 160 color
clocks (40 characters), and wide
playfield is 192 color clocks wide (48
characters). A color clock is a
physical measure of horizontal
distance on the TV screen. There are a
total of 228 color clocks on a line,
but only some of these (usually 176
maximum) will be visible due to screen
limitations. A pixel, on the other
hand, is a logical unit which varies
in size with the GRAPHICS mode. Due to
the limitations of most TV sets, you
will not be able to see all of the
wide playfield unless you scroll into
the offscreen portions.  BIT 5 must be
set to enable ANTIC operation; it
enables DMA for fetching the display
list instructions.
