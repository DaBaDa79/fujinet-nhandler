(W) Serial port data output. Usually
written to in the event of a serial
data out interrupt. Writes to the
eight bit (one byte) parallel
holding register that is transferred
to the serial shift register when a
full byte of data has been
transmitted. This "holding" register
is used to contain the bits to be
transmitted one at a time (serially)
as a one-byte unit before
transmission.

              SERIN

(R) Serial port input. Reads the
one-byte parallel holding register
that is loaded when a full byte of
serial input data has been received.
As above, this holding register is
used to hold the bits as they are
received one bit at a time until a
full byte is received. This byte is
then taken by the computer for
processing. Also used to verify the
checksum value at location 49 ($31).

The serial bus is the port on the
Atari into which you plug your
cassette or disk cable. For the pin
values of this port, see the OS
User's Manual, p. 133, and the
Hardware Manual.
