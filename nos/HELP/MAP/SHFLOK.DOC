702          02BE          SHFLOK

Flag for the shift and control keys.
It returns zero for lowercase letters,
64 ($40) for all uppercase (called
caps lock: uppercase is required for
BASIC statements and is also the
default mode on powerup). SHFLOK will
set characters to all caps during your
program if 64 is POKEd here. Returns
the value 128 ($80; control-lock) when
the CTRL key is pressed. Forced
control-lock will cause all keys to
output their control-code functions or
graphics figures. Other values POKEd
here may cause the system to crash.
You can use this location with 694
($2B6) above to convert all keyboard
entries to uppercase, normal display
by:

10   OPEN #2,4,0,"K:"
20   GET #2,A
30   GOSUB 1000
40   PRINT CHR$(A);: GOTO 20
.
.
.
1000 IF A = 155 THEN 1030: REM RETURN KEY
1010 IF A > = 128 THEN A = A - 128: REM RESTORE TO NORMAL DISPLAY
1020 IF PEEK (702) = 0 AND A > 96 THEN A = A - 32: REM LOWERCASE TO UPPER
1030 POKE 702,64: POKE 694,0
1040 RETURN
