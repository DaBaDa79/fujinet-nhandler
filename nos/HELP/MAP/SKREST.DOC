53770          D20A          SKREST

(W) Reset BITs 5 - 7 of the serial
port status register at 53775 to one.

              RANDOM

(R) When this location is read, it
acts as a random number generator. It
reads the high order eight bits of the
17 bit polynomial counter (nine bit if
BIT 7 of AUDCTL is set) for the value
of the number. You can use this
location in a program to generate a
random integer between zero and 255 by:

10  PRINT PEEK(53770)

This is a more elegant solution than
INT(RND(0) * 256). For a test of the
values in this register, use this
simple program:

10 FOR N = 1 TO 20: PRINT PEEK(53770): NEXT N
