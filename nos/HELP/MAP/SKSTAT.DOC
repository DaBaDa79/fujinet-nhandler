(W) Serial port control. Holds the
value 255 ($255) if no key is
pressed, 251 ($FB) for most other
keys pressed, 247 ($F7) for SHIFT
key pressed (*M). See the (R) mode
below for an explanation of the bit
functions. POKE with three to stop
the occasional noise from cassette
after I/O to bring POKEY out of the
two-tone mode. (562).

              SKSTAT

(R) Reads the serial port status. It
also returns values governed by a
signal on the digital track of the
cassette tape. You can generate
certain values using the SOUND
command in BASIC and a PEEK to
SKSTAT:

SOUND 0,5,10,15 returns a value to
here of 255 (or, on occasion, 127).
SOUND 0,8,10,3 returns a value of
239.

This is handy for adding a voice
track to Atari tapes. You use the
left channel for your voice track
and the right for the tone(s) you
want to use as cuing marks. You can
use the speaker on your TV to
generate the tones by placing the
right microphone directly in front
of the speaker. The computer will
register these tones in this
register when it encounters them
during a later cassette load. See
COMPUTE!, July 1981, for some other
suggestions on doing this.
Bemember, you can turn the cassette
off by POKEing 54018 ($D302) with 60
($3C) and back on with 52 ($34).

Bits in the SKCTL (W) register are
normally zero and perform the
functions below when set to one. The
status when used as (R) is listed
below the write (W) function:

Bit   Function
0     (W) Enable keyboard debounce
          circuits.
      (R) Not used by SKSTAT.
1     (W) Enable keyboard scanning
          circuit.
      (R) Serial input shift register
      busy.
2     (W) Fast pot scan: the pot scan
          counter completes its sequ-
          ence in two TV line times
          instead of one frame time
          (228 scan lines).
          Not as accurate as the
          normal pot scan, however.
      (R) the last key is still
          pressed.
3     (W) Serial output is trans-
          mitted as a two-tone
signal
          rather than a logic true/
          false. POKEY two-tone mode.
      (R) The shift key is pressed.
4,5,6 (W) Serial port mode control
          used to set the bi-direct-
          ional clock lines so that
          you can either receive ext-
          ernal clock data or provide
          clock data to external dev-
          ices (see the Hardware
          Manual, p. II.27). There
          are two pins on the serial
          port for Clock IN and Clock
          OUT data. See the OS User's
           Manual, p. 133.
4     (R) Data can be read directly
          from the serial input port,
          ignoring the shift register
5     (R) Keyboard over-run. Reset
          BITs 7 to 5 (latches) to
          one using SKRES at 53770
         ($D20A).
6     (R) Serial data input over-run.
          Reset latches as above.
7     (W) Force break (serial output
          to zero).
      (R) Serial data input frame
          error caused by missing or
          extra bits. Reset latches
          as above.

BIT 2 is first set to zero to reset
POT registers to zero (dumping the
capacitors used to change the POT
registers). Then BIT 2 is set to one
to enable the fast scan. Fast scan
is not as accurate as the normal
scan routine. BIT 2 must be reset to
zero to enable the normal scan mode;
otherwise, the capacitors will never
dump.
