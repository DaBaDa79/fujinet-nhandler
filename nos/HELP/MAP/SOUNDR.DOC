Noisy I/O flag used by SIO to signal
the beeping heard during disk and
cassette I/O. POKE here with zero for
blessed silence during these
operations. Other numbers return the
beep. In- itialized to three. The
hardware solution to this problem is
to turn your speaker volume down. This
can also be used to silence the
digital track when playing
synchronized voice/data tapes. See
location 54018.
