48869          BEE5          SQR

Calculate square root (FR0) with
carry.  Note that there is some
conflict of addresses for the above
routines. The addresses given are
from the first edition of De Re
Atari. The Atari OS Source Code
Listing gives the following
addresses for these FP routines:

These are entry points, not actual
start addresses.

SIN     48513   ($BD81)
COS     48499   ($BD73)
ATAN    48707   ($BE43)
SQR     48817   ($BEB1)

However, after disassembling the
BASIC ROMs, I found that the
addresses in De Re Atari appear to
be correct.

49146,7        BFFA,B
Left cartridge start address.

49148          BFFC
A non-zero number here tells the OS
that there is no cartridge in the
left slot.

49149          BFFD
Option byte. A cartridge which does
not specify a disk boot may use all
of the memory from 1152 ($480) to
MEMTOP any way it sees fit.

49150,1        BFFE,F
Cartridge initialization address.
See the above section on the right
slot, 32768 to 40959, for more
information.

-------------------------------------
When a BASIC program is SAVEd, only
14 of the more than 50 page zero
locations BASIC uses are written to
the disk or cassette with the
program. The rest are all
recalculated with a NEW or SAVE
command, sometimes with RUN or GOTO.
These 14 locations are:

128,129   80,81    LOMEM
130,131   82,83    VNTP
132,133   84,85    VNTD
134,135   86,87    VVTP
136,137   88,89    STMTAB
138,139   8A,8B    STMCUR
140,141   8C,8D    STARP

The string/array space is not
loaded; STARP is included only to
point to the end of the BASIC
program.
The two other critical BASIC page
zero pointers, which are not
SAVEd with the program, are:

142,143   8E,8F    RUNSTK
144,145   90,91    MEMTOP

-------------------------------------
Locations 49152 to 53247 ($C000 to
$CFFF) are unused.  Unfortunately,
this rather large 4K block of memory
cannot be written to by the user, so
it is presently useless. Apparently,
this area of ROM is reserved for
future expansion. Rumors abound
about new Atari OS's that allow 3-D
graphics, 192K of on-board RAM and
other delights.  Most likely this
space will be consumed in the next
OS upgrade.  PEEKing this area will
show it not to be completely empty;
it was apparently used for system
development in Atari's paleozoic
age.  Although the Atari is
technically a 64K machine (1K equals
1024 bytes, so 64K equals 65536
bytes), you don't really have all
64K to use. The OS takes up 10K;
there is the 4K block here that's
unused, plus a few other unused
areas in the ROM and, of course,
there are the hardware chips. BASIC
(or any cartridge) uses another 8K.
The bottom 1792 bytes are used by
the OS, BASIC, and floating point
package. Then DOS and DUP take up
their memory space, not to mention
the 850 handler if booted -- leaving
you with more or less 38K of RAM to
use for your BASIC programming.
