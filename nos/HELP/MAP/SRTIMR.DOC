555          022B          SRTIMR

Software repeat timer, controlled by
the IRQ device routine. It
establishes the initial 1/2 second
delay before a key will repeat.
Stage two VBLANK establishes the
1/10 second repeat rate, decrements
the timer and implements the auto
repeat logic.  Every time a key is
pressed, STIMER is set to 48 ($30).
Whenever SRTIMR is equal to zero and
a key is being continuously pressed,
the value of that key is continually
stored in CH, location 764 ($2FC).
