767          02FF          SSFLAG

Start/stop display screen flag, used
to stop the scrolling of the screen
during a DRAW or graphics routine, a
LISTing or a PRINTing. When the value
is zero, the screen output is not
stopped. When the value is 255 ($FF;
the one's complement), the output to
the screen is stopped, and the machine
waits for the value to become zero
again before continuing with the
scrolling display. Normally SSFLAG is
toggled by the user during these
operations by pressing the CTRL-1 keys
combination to both start and stop the
scroll. Set to zero by RESET and
powerup.
