Serial port control register, shadow
for 53775 ($D20F). Setting the bits in
this register to one has the following
effect:

Bit   Dec   Function
 0      1   Enable the keyboard
            debounce circuit.
 1      2   Enable the keyboard
            scanning circuit.
 2      4   The pot counter completes
            a read within two scan
            lines instead of one
            frame time.
 3      8   Serial output transmitted
            as two-tone instead of
            logic true/false (POKEY
            two-tone mode).
4-6  16-64  Serial port mode control.
 7     128  Force break; serial
            output to zero.

Initialized to 19 ($13) which sets
bits zero, one and four.
