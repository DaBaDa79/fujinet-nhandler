PAGE ONE: THE STACK

Locations 256 to 511 ($100 to $1FF)
are the stack area for the OS, DOS and
BASIC. This area is page one. Machine
language JSR, PHA and interrupts all
cause data to be written to page one,
and RTS, PLA and RTI instructions all
read data from page one. On powerup or
RESET, the stack pointer is
initialized to point to location 511
($1FF). The stack then pushes downward
with each entry to 256 ($100). In case
of overflow, the stack will wrap
around from 256 back to 511 again.

--------------------------------------
PAGES TWO TO FOUR

Locations 512 to 1151 ($200 to $47F)
are used by the OS for working
variables, tables and data buffers. In
this area, locations 512 to 553 ($200
to $229) are used for interrupt
vectors, and locations 554 to 623
($22A to $26F) are for miscellaneous
use. Much of pages two through five
cannot be used except by the OS unless
specifically noted. A number of bytes
are marked as "spare", i.e., not in
use currently. The status of these
bytes may change with an Atari
upgrade, so their use is not
recommended.

There are two types of interrupts:
Non-Maskable Interrupts (NMI)
processed by the ANTIC chip and
Interrupt Requests (IRQ) processed by
the POKEY and the PIA chips. NMI's are
for the VBLANK interrupts (VBI's; 546
to 549, $222 to $225), display list
interrupts (DLI) and RESET key
interrupts. They initiate the stage
one and stage two VBLANK procedures;
usually vectored through an OS service
routine, they can be vectored to point
to a user routine. IRQ's are for the
timer interrupts, peripheral and
serial bus interrupts, BREAK and other
key interrupts, and 6502 BRK
instruction interrupts. They can
usually be used to vector to user
routines. See NMIST 54287 ($D40F) and
IRQEN 53774 ($D20E) for more
information. NMI interrupt vectors are
marked NMI; IRQ interrupt vectors are
marked IRQ.  Refer to the chart below
location 534 for a list of the
interrupt vectors in the new OS "B"
version ROMs.
