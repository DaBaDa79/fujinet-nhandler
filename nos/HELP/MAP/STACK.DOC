PAGE ONE: THE STACK

Locations 256 to 511 ($100 to $1FF)
are the stack area for the OS, DOS
and BASIC. This area is page one.
Machine language JSR, PHA and
interrupts all cause data to be
written to page one, and RTS, PLA
and RTI instructions all read data
from page one. On powerup or RESET,
the stack pointer is initialized to
point to location 511 ($1FF). The
stack then pushes downward with each
entry to 256 ($100). In case of
overflow, the stack will wrap around
from 256 back to 511 again.
