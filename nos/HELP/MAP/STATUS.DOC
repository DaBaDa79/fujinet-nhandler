48          0030          STATUS

Internal status storage. The SIO
routines in ROM use this byte to store
the status of the current SIO
operation. See page 166 of the OS
User's Manual for status values.
STATUS uses location 793 ($319) as
temporary storage. STATUS is also used
as a storage register for the timeout,
BREAK abort and error values during
SIO routines.
