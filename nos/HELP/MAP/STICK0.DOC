The value of joystick 0. STICK
registers are shadow locations for PIA
locations 54016 and 54017 ($D300,
$D301). There are nine possible
decimal values (representing 45 degree
incrememts) read by each joystick
register (using the STICKn command),
depending on the position of the stick:

 Decimal                Binary
    14                    1110
     |                      |
  10 | 6               1010 | 0110
    \|/                    \|/
11--15---7          1011--1111--0111
    /|\                    /|\
   9 | 5               1001 | 0101
     |                      |
    13                    1101

15 (1111) equals stick in the upright
(neutral) position.

See Micro, December 1981,for an
article on making a proportional
joystick. For an example of a machine
language joystick driver you can add
to your BASIC program, see COMPUTE!,
July 1981.

One machine language joystick reader
is listed below, based on an article
in COMPUTE!, August 1981:
