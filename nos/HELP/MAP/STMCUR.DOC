Current BASIC statement pointer, used
to access the tokens being currently
processed within a line of the
statement table.  When BASIC is
awaiting input, this pointer is set to
the beginning of the immediate mode
(line 32768).

Using the address of the variable name
table, the length, and the current
statement (locations 130 to 133, 138,
139), here is a way to protect your
programs from being LISTed or LOADed:
they can only be RUN! Remember, that
restricts you too, so make sure you
have SAVEd an unchanqed version before
you do this:

32000 FOR VARI = PEEK(130) + PEEK(131) * 256 TO PEEK(132) + PEEK(133) * 256:POKE VARI,155:NEXT VARI
32100 POKE PEEK(138) + PEEK(139) * 256 + 2,0: SAVE "D:filename": NEW

This will cause all variable names to
be replaced with a RETURN character.
Other characters may be used: simply
change 155 for the appropriate ATASCII
code for the character desired. Make
sure that these are the last two lines
of your program and that NEW is the
last statement. CLOAD will not work,
but a filename with C: will.
