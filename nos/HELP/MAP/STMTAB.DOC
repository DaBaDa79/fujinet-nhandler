136          0088          STMTAB

The address of the statement table
(which is the beginning of the user's
BASIC program), containing all the
tokenized lines of code plus the
immediate mode lines entered by the
user. Line numbers are stored as
two-byte integers, and immediate mode
lines are given the default value of
line 32768 ($8000). The first two
bytes of a tokenized line are the line
number, and the next is a dummy byte
reserved for the byte count (or
offset) from the start of this line to
the start of the next line.

Following that is another count byte
for the start of this line to the
start of the next statement. These
count values are set only when
tokenization for the line and
statement are complete.  Tokenization
takes place in a 256 byte ($100)
buffer that resides at the end of the
reserved OS RAM (pointed to by
locations 128, 129; $80, $81).  To see
the starting address of your BASIC
line numbers use this routine:

10 STMTAB = PEEK(136) + PEEK(137)*256
20 NUM = PEEK(STMTAB) + PEEK (STMTAB+1)*256
30 IF NUM = 32768 THEN END
40 PRINT"LINE NUMBER: ";NUM;" ADDRESS: ";STMTAB
50 STMTAB = STMTAB + PEEK(STMTAB+2)
60 GOTO 20

The August 1982 issue of ANTIC
provided a useful program to delete a
range of BASIC line numbers. The
routine can be appended to your
program and even be used to delete
itself.
