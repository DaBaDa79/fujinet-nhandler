Stick trigger 0. This and the next
three locations perform the same
function as the PTRIG locations except
for the joysticks.  Like PTBIG, zero
is returned when the button is
pressed; one is returned when it is
not. STRIG registers are shadow
registers for GTIA/CTIA locations
53264 to 53267 ($D010 to $D013).
