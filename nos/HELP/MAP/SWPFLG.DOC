Split-screen cursor control. Equal to
255 ($FF) if the text window RAM and
regular RAM are swapped; otherwise, it
is equal to zero. In split-screen
modes, the graphics cursor data and
the text window data are frequently
swapped in order to get the values
associated with the area being
accessed into the OS data base
locations 84 to 95 ($54 to $5F).
SWPFLG helps to keep track of which
data set is in these locations.
