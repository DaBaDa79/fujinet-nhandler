(W) Graphics for player 3.

              TRIG0

(R) Joystick trigger 0 (644).
Controller jack one, pin six. For
all triggers, zero equals button
pressed, one equals not pressed. If
BIT 2 of GRACTL (53277; $D01D) is
set to one, then all TRIG BITs 0 are
latched when the button is pressed
(set to zero) and are only reset to
one (not pressed) when BIT 2 of
GRACTL is reset to zero. The effect
of latching the triggers is to
return a constant "button pressed"
read until reset.
