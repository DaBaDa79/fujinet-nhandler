Text window cursor column; value
ranges from zero to 39. Unless
changed by the user, location 658
will always be zero (there are only
40 columns in the display, so the
MSB will be zero). Since POSITION,
PLOT, LOCATE and similar commands
refer to the graphics cursor in the
display area above the text window,
you must use POKE statements to
write to this area if PRINT
statements are insufficient.
