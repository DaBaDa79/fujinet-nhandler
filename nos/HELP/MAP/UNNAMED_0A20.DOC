UNNAMED_0A20

In COMPUTE!, May and July 1982, Bill
Wilkinson discussed BURST I/O, which
should not take place when a file is
OPEN for update, but does, due to a
minor bug in DOS 2.0 (see also Inside
Atari DOS, Chapter 12). This will
cause update writes to work properly,
but update reads to be bad. The
following POKEs will correct the
problem. Remember to save DOS back to
a new disk.

POKE 2592,130         ($A20,82)
POKE 2593,19          ($A21,13)
POKE 2594,73          ($A22,49)
POKE 2595,12          ($A23,0C)
POKE 2596,240         ($A24,F0)
POKE 2597,36          ($A25,24)
POKE 2598,106         ($A26,6A)
POKE 2599,234         ($A27,EA)
POKE 2625,16          ($A41,10)
POKE 2773,31          ($AD5,1F)

(Note that the July 1982 issue of
COMPUTE! contained a typo where the
value to be POKEd into 2773 was
mistakenly listed as 13, not 31!)
Wilkinson points out that one way to
completely disable BURST I/O (useful
in some circumstances such as using
the DOS BINARY SAVE to save the
contents of ROM to disk!) is by:

POKE 2606,0           ($A2E,0)

This, however, will make the system
LOAD and SAVE files considerably more
slowly, so it's not recommended as a
permanent change to DOS.
