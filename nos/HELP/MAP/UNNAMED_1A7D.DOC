Start of the drive and data buffers.
Drive buffers are numbered
sequentially one to four, data buffers
one to eight, assuming that many are
allocated for each. Normally, the
first two buffers are allocated for
drives and the next three for data.
Buffers are 128 ($80) bytes long each
and start at 6908 ($1AFC), 7036
($1B7C), 7162 ($1BFA) and 7292
($1C7C). See locations 1801 and 1802
($709, $70A).
