Spare bytes. It is not recommended
that you use the spare bytes for
your own program use. In later
upgrades of the OS, these bytes may
be used, causing a conflict with
your program. For example, the new
OS ROMs use locations 652 and 653
($28C, $28D) in the new IRQ
interrupt handler routines. It is
best to use a protected area of
memory such as page six, locations
1536 to 1791 ($600 to $6FF).

----------------------------------------
Locations 656 to 703 ($290 to $2BF)
are used for the screen RAM display
handler (depending on GRAPHICS mode).

In split-screen mode, the text
window is controlled by the screen
editor (E:), while the graphics
region is controlled by the display
handler (S:), using two separate
IOCB's. Two separate cursors are
also maintained. The display handler
will set AUX1 of the IOCB to split-
screen option. Refer to the IOCB
area, locations 832 to 959 ($340 to
$3BF). See COMPUTE!, February 1982,
for a program to put GR.1 and GR.2
into the text window area. The text
window uses 160 bytes of RAM located
just below RAMTOP (see location 106;
$6A). See location 88 ($58) for a
chart of screen RAM use.
