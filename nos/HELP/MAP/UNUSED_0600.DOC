UNUSED_0600

Page six: 256 ($FF) bytes protected
from OS use. Page six is not used by
the OS and may be safely used for
machine language subroutines, special
I/O handlers, altered character sets,
or whatever the user can fit into the
space. Some problem may arise when the
INPUT statement retrieves more than
128 characters.  The locations from
1536 to 1663 ($600 to $67F) are then
immediately used as a buffer for the
excess characters. To avoid overflow,
keep INPUT statements from retrieving
more than 128 characters. The valFORTH
implementation of fig-FORTH (from
ValPar International) uses all of page
six for its boot code, so it is not
available for your use. However, FORTH
allows you to reserve other blocks of
memory for similar functions. BASIC A+
uses locations $0600 - $67F.

---------------------------------------
Locations 1792 to the address
specified by LOMEM (locations 128,
129; ($80, $81) - the pointer to BASIC
low memory) are also used by DOS and
the File Management System (FMS).
Refer to the DOS source code and
Inside Atari DOS for details. The
addresses which follow are those for
DOS 2.0S, the official Atari DOS at
the time of this writing. Another DOS
is available as an alternative to DOS
2.0 -- K-DOS (TM), from K-BYTE (R).
K-DOS is not menu driven but command
driven. It does not use all of the
same memory locations as the Atari DOS
although it does use a modified
version of the Atari FMS. (Another
command-driven DOS, called OS/A+, is
completely compatible with DOS 2.OS
and is available from OSS, the
creators of DOS 2.0S.)

1792-5377      700-1501

File management system RAM (pages
seven to fifteen). FMS provides the
interface between BASIC or DUP and the
disk drive. It is a sophisticated
device driver for all I/O operations
involving the D: device. It allows
disk users to use the special BASIC
XIO disk commands (see the IOCB area
832 to 959: $340 to $3BF). It is
resident in RAM below your BASIC RAM
and provides the entry point to DOS
when called by BASIC.

5440-13062     1540-3306

DUP.SYS RAM. The top will vary with
the amount of buffer storage space
allocated to the drive and sector
buffers.

6780-7547      1A7C-1D7B

Drive buffers and sector-data buffers.
The amount of memory will vary with
the number of buffers allocated.

MEMLO">
7548-MEMLO     1D7C-3306 (maximum)

Non-resident portion of DUP.SYS, DOS
utility routines. DUP provides the
utilities chosen from the DOS menu
page, not from BASIC. It is not
resident in RAM when you are using
BASIC or another cartridge; rather it
is loaded when DOS is called from
BASIC or on autoboot powerup (and no
cartridge supersedes it).  When DUP is
loaded, it overwrites the lower
portion of memory.  If you wish to
save your program from destruction,
you must have created a MEM.SAV file
on disk before you called DOS from
your program. See the DOS Reference
Manual.

---------------------------------------
Locations 1792 to 2047 ($700 to $7FF;
page seven) are the user boot area.
MEMLO and LOMEM point to 1792 when no
DOS or DUP program is loaded. This
area can then be used for your BASIC
or machine language programs. The
lowest free memory address is 1792,
and programs may extend upwards from
here. There is a one-page buffer
before the program space used for the
tokenization of BASIC statements,
pointed to by locations 128, 129 ($80,
$81). Actually a program may start
from any address above 1792 and below
the screen display list as long as it
does not overwrite this buffer if it
is a BASIC program. Also, 1792 is the
start of the FMS portion of DOS when
resident.

When software is booted, the MEMLO
pointer at 743,744 ($2E7,$2E8) in the
OS data base (locations 512 to 1151;
$512 to $47F) points to the first free
memory location above that software;
otherwise, it points to 1792. The DUP
portion of DOS is partly resident
here, starting at 5440 ($1540) and
running to 13062 ($1540 to $3306). The
location of the OS disk boot entry
routine (DOBOOT) is 62189 ($F2ED). The
standard Atari DOS 2.OS takes up
sectors one through 83 ($53) on a
disk. Sector one is the boot sector.
Sectors two through 40 ($28) are the
FMS portion, and sectors 41 ($29)
through 83 are the DUP.SYS portion of
DOS. For more information, see the DOS
and OS source listings and Inside
Atari DOS.

---------------------------------------
FMS, DOS.SYS and DUP.SYS

Disk boot records (sector one on a
disk) are read into 1792 ($700).
Starting from $700 (1792), the format
is:

Byte  Hex     Label and use
0     700     BFLAG: Boot flag equals
              zero (unused).
1     701     BRCNT: Number of cons-
              ecutive sectors to read
              (if the file is DOS,
              then BRCNT equals one).
2,3   702,703 BLDADR: Boot sector
              load address ($700).
4,5   704,705 BIWTARR: Init addr.
6     706     JMP XBCONT: Boot cont-
              inuation vector; $4C
              (76): JMP command to
              next address in bytes
              seven and eight.
7,8   707,708 Boot read continuation
              address (LSB/MSB).
9     709     SABYTE: Maximum number
              of concurrently OPEN
              files. The default is
              three (see 1801 below).
10    70A     DRVBYT: Drive bits: the
              maximum number of
              drives attached to the
              system. The default is
              two (see 1802 below).
11    70B     (unused) Buffer alloc-
              ation direction, set
              to zero.
12,13 70C,70D SASA: Buffer allocation
              start address. Points
              to 1995 ($7CB) when DOS
              is loaded.
14    70E     DSFLG: DOS flag. Boot
              flag set to non-zero.
              Must be non-zero for
              the second phase of
              boot process. Indicates
              that the file DOS.SYS
              has been written to the
              disk;
              0 = no DOS file,
              1 = 128 byte sect disk,
              2 = 256 byte sect disk.
15,16 70F,710 DFLINK: Pointer to the
              first sector of DOS.SYS
              file.
17    711     BLDISP: Displacement to
              the sector link byte
              125 ($7D). The sector
              link byte is the poin-
              ter to the next disk
              sector to be read. If
              it is zero, the end of
              the file has been
              reached.
18,19 712,713 DFLADR: Address of the
start of DOS.SYS file.
20+   714+    Continuation of the boot
load file. See the OS User's Manual
and Chapter 20 of Inside Atari DOS.

Data from the boot sector is placed in
locations 1792 to 1916 ($700 to $77C).
Data from the rest of DOS.SYS is
located starting from 1917 ($77D). All
binary file loads start with 255
($FF). The next four bytes are the
start and end addresses (LSB/MSB),
respectively.
