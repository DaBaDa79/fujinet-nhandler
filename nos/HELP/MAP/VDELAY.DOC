(W) Vertical delay register. Used to
give one-line resolution movement
capability in the vertical positioning
of an object when the two line
resolution display is enabled. Setting
a bit in VDELAY to one moves the
corresponding object down by one TV
line. If DMA is enabled, then moving
an object by more than one line is
accomplished by moving bits in the
memory map instead.
