534          0216          VIMIRQ

The IRQ immediate vector (general).
Initialized to 59126 ($E6F6). JMP
through here to determine cause of the
IRQ interrupt. Note that with the new
("B") OS ROMs, there is a BREAK key
interrupt vector at locations 566, 567
($236, $237).  See 53774 ($D20E) for
more information on IRQ interrupts.

The new "B" version OS ROMs change the
vectors above as follows:

VDSLST     59280 ($E790)
VPRCED     59279 ($E78F)
VINTER     59279 ($E78F)
VBREAK     59279 ($E78F)
VKEYBD     NO CHANGE
VSERIN     60175 ($EB0F)
VSEROR     NO CHANGE
VSEROC     60111 ($EACF)
VTIMR 1-4  59279 ($E78F)
VIMIRQ     59142 ($E706)
VVBLKI     59310 ($E7AE)
VVBLKD     59653 ($E905)

---------------------------------------
The locations from 536 to 558 ($218 to
$22E) are used for the system software
timers. Hardware timers are located in
the POKEY chip and use the AUDF
registers. These timers count
backwards every 1/60 second (stage one
VBLANK) or 1/30 second (stage two
VBLANK) interval until they reach
zero. If the VBLANK process is
disabled or intercepted, the timers
will not be updated. See De Re Atari
for information regarding setting
these timers in an assembly routine
using the SETVBV register (58460;
$E45C). These locations are user-
accessible and can be made to count
time for music duration, game I/O,
game clock and other functions.
Software timers are used for durations
greater than one VBLANK interval (1/60
second). For periods of shorter
duration, use the hardware registers.
