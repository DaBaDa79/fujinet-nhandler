Pointer to the ending address of the
variable name table plus one byte.
When fewer than 128 variables are
present, it points to a dummy zero
byte. When 128 variables are present,
this points to the last byte of the
last variable name, plus one.

It is often useful to be able to list
your program variables; using
locations 130 to 133, you can do that
by:

10  VARI = PEEK(130) + PEEK(131) * 256 :REM This gives you the start of the table.
20  FOR VARI = VARI TO PEEK(132) + PEEK(133) * 256 - 1: PRINT CHR$(PEEK(VARI) - 128 * PEEK(VARI > 127)); CHR$(27 + 128 * PEEK(VARI) > 127));:NEXT VARI
25  REM this finds the end of the variable name table (remember table is end + 1). then PRINTs ASCII characters < 128
30  NUM = 0: FOR VARI = PEEK(130) + PEEK(313) * 256 TO PEEK(132) + PEEK(131) * 256 - 1:NUM = NUM + (PEEK(VARI) < 127):NEXT VARI: PRINT NUM; "Variables in use"

Or try this, for a possibly less
opaque example of the same routine:

1000  NUM = 0: FOR LOOP = PEEK (130) + PEEK(131) * 256 TO PEEK(132) + PEEK(133) * 256 - 1
1010  IF PEEK(LOOP) < 128 THEN PRINT CHR$(PEEK(LOOP));: GOTO 1030
1020  PRINT CHR$(PEEK(LOOP) - 128): NUM - NUM + 1
1030  NEXT LOOP: PRINT; PRINT NUM; "VARIABLES IN USE": END
