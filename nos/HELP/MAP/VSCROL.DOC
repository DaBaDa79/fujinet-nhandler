(W) Vertical scroll enable, POKE
VSCROL with from zero to 16 scan
lines, depending on the GRAPHICS mode
of the screen for the number of scan
lines to scroll. Vertical fine scrolls
can be used only if BIT 5 of the
display list instruction has been set.

Coarse scrolling can be done without
using this register, simply by moving
the top of the screen address (as
defined by the DL LMS instruction) up
or down one mode line (plus or minus
40 or 20 bytes, depending on the
GRAPHICS mode). The top of the screen
address can be found by:

10  DLIST = PEEK(560) + PEEK(561) * 256
20  SCRNLO = DLIST + 4: SCRNHI = DLIST + 5: REM LSB/MSB OF SCREEN ADDRESS
25  PRINT "SCREEN ADDRESS = " PEEK(SCRNLO) + PEEK(SCRNHI) * 256

You could then add a routine to this
for a coarse - scroll vertically
through the memory with a joystick,
such as:

30  LOBYTE = 0: HIBYTE = 0
40  IF STICK(0) = 14 THEN LOBYTE = LOBYTE + 40:GOTO 100
50  IF STICK(0) = 13 THEN LOBYTE = LOBYTE - 40
60  IF LOBYTE < 0 THEN LOBYTE = LOBYTE + 256: HIBYTE = HIBYTE - 1
70  IF HIBYTE < 0 THEN HIBYTE = 0
80  GOTO 200
100 IF LOBYTE 255 THEN LOBYTE = LOBYTE - 256
110 HIBYTE = HIBYTE + 1
200 POKE SCRNLOW, LOBYTE: POKE SCRNHI, HIBYTE
210 GOTO 40

Coarse scrolling is relatively easy to
implement in the Atari: one basically
alters the screen RAM to display the
new material. Fine scrolling is more
difficult: each scroll register must
be POKEd with the number of units to
be scrolled -- color clocks or scan
lines -- and the corresponding display
list instructions must have the proper
bits set. This means you can
selectively fine scroll any mode lines
you wish by setting only those bits of
the lines you intend to scroll. Other
lines will be displayed normally. You
can set a DL instruction for both
horizontal and vertical scroll enable.
 See the Hardware Manual for a
discussion of the problems in fine
scrolling.

Fine scrolling will allow only a
certain amount of data to be scrolled
before the register must be reset (16
clock bits or scan lines maximum). In
order to make the scrolling activity
continuous, the register involved must
be reset to zero when the desired
value is reached, a coarse scroll must
be implemented (usually during a DLI
or VBLANK interval) and a new fine
scroll begun. This is not easily done
in BASIC since it is too slow, and
changing registers during ANTIC's
display process usually causes rough
or jerky motion. Assembly routines are
suggested for smooth display. See De
Re Atari, Micro, November 1981, BYTE,
January 1982, and Santa Cruz's Tricky
Tutorial #2 for more information.
