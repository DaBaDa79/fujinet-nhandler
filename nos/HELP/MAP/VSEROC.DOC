POKEY serial bus transmit complete
interrupt vector, initialized to 60113
($EAD1), which sets a transmission
done flag after the checksum byte is
sent. IRQ.

SIO uses the three last interrupts to
control serial bus communication with
the serial bus devices. During serial
bus communication, all program
execution is halted. The actual serial
I/O is interrupt driven; POKEY waits
and watches for a flag to be set when
the requested I/O operation is
completed. During this wait, POKEY is
sending or receiving bits along the
seriai bus. When the entire byte has
been transmitted (or received), the
output needed (VSEROR) or the input
ready (VSERIN) IRQ is generated
according to the direction of the data
flow. This causes the next byte to be
processed until the entire buffer has
been sent or is full, and a flag for
"transmission done" is set. At this
point, SIO exits back to the calling
routine. You can see that SIO wastes
time waiting for POKEY to send or
receive the information on the bus.
