8          0008          WARMST

Warmstart flag. If the location reads
zero, then it is in the middle of
powerup; 255 is the normal RESET
status. Warmstart is similar to
pressing RESET, so should not wipe out
memory, variables, or programs. WARMST
is initialized to zero and will not
change values unless POKEd or until
the first time the RESET button is
pressed. It will then read 255 ($FF).

Warmstart normally vectors to location
58484 ($E474). WARMST is checked by
the NMI status register at 54287
($D40F) when RESET is pressed to see
whether or not to re-initialize the
software or to re-boot the disk.
