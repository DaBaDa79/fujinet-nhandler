REENTER - 

Jump to the memory address stored in
RUNAD ($02E0).

Usage:

REENTER

Attempt to re-enter a memory-resident
program by jumping from the command
processor to the address loitering in
RUNAD ($02E0).

For example, if an application has a
`QUIT TO DOS` function, it may be
possible to exit, perform a task in
the NOS command processor, and then
jump back into the application with-
out having to re-load the binary file
from the network.

The success of the `REENTER` command
depends on the application. Also, be
aware that the entry point for an
application may clear any previous
work in memory, so save any work
before quitting to DOS.
