TYPE - Displays the contents of a
text file to the screen.

The `TYPE` command clears the screen
and prints the contents of a text
file to the  display.

The text stream is paused once the
screen is full.  Press any key to
display the next page.

text stream.

Known issue: Executing `TYPE` on a
non-text file can overrun the
assigned buffer and corrupt memory.
